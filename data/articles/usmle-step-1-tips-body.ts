<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>This <strong>mega-guide</strong> walks international medical students (IMGs) through every aspect of USMLE Step 1 preparation. We compare <strong>study plans</strong> (3, 6, 9–12 months), daily schedules, and how to balance study with med school or work. We cover <strong>high-yield strategies</strong> (active recall, spaced repetition/Anki, question banks), plus key resources (First Aid, UWorld, Pathoma, Sketchy, and free community content) with pros/cons. We detail <strong>logistics</strong>: ECFMG certification, Prometric scheduling abroad, required ID, COVID policies, <a href="https://www.usmle.org/reschedule-exam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rescheduling rules</a> (e.g. no fee if &gt;45 days out). <strong>Financials</strong>: <a href="https://academically.com/blogs/usmle-step-1-exam-fees-and-additional-costs-in-2026-complete-breakdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exam fees</a> (~$1,020 + $205 international surcharge), <a href="https://www.ecfmg.org/2026ib/eligibility-usmle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ECFMG</a> fee (~$160), study materials, travel, and budgeting tips. We explain <strong>residency implications</strong>: how Step 1 scores affect IMG match chances, timing vs ERAS, and ECFMG certification timeline. <strong>Test-day advice</strong> covers pacing, breaks, nutrition (pack snacks and water), and <a href="https://www.usmle.org/what-to-know/exam-day-information/admission-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">checklists</a> (bring permit, passport). We list <strong>common pitfalls</strong> (passive reading, ignoring weak areas, Qbank misuse, burnout) and <strong>mental health</strong> tactics (breaks, exercise, realistic goals, community support). Throughout we interweave <strong>real student insights</strong> (from Reddit and YouTube) to keep the tone informal and actionable. Actionable templates (3-month and 6-month study schedules, daily checklists, pre-test checklist) are provided below.</p>

<div id="study-timeline"></div>

<h2>Study Timelines &amp; Plans</h2>

<p>International students choose varied timelines. A <strong>3-month plan</strong> can work if you study full-time with <em>no other obligations</em>. This means waking early, doing <strong>40–80 UWorld questions/day</strong>, and covering all subjects quickly. Many peers warn it's "doable if you have all 3 months completely off", but otherwise aim for 6 months. A <strong>6-month plan</strong> is common, especially if juggling school or jobs. It allows systematic coverage (we suggest 5–6 days/week, 6–8 hours/day) and periodic review. Some even use <strong>9–12 months</strong> to avoid burnout, taking breaks between phases (e.g. 2–3 months per major block, then practice tests). Others caution that &gt;6–8 months might lead to diminishing returns.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Advice from a recent IMG:</strong> "Generally 6 months of actual study…is fine for most people."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Contrasting view:</strong> Some IMGs purposely use a year (with rest weeks) for depth: "If you need 12 months, utilise it, there is no rush… break it down by topics."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Speedrun plan:</strong> "If you can manage more time, take more time… if target 3 months, manage 80 Q/day."</p></blockquote>

<div class="article-tip">
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Create a <strong>daily/weekly schedule</strong> assigning topics (e.g. 2–3 hours videos/notes + Qbank + Anki blocks). Use active recall and spaced repetition (see next). Always track progress with practice exams (see below). Adjust plan if rotating or working part-time — e.g., wake early, study during breaks, reserve weekends for heavy review (one IMG studied 6–7 hours daily plus Anki during clinic breaks).</p>
</div>

<div id="study-strategies"></div>

<h2>High-Yield Study Strategies &amp; Resources</h2>

<p><strong>Active recall &amp; Spaced repetition:</strong> Do <strong>self-quizzing</strong> whenever possible. Before learning a topic, test yourself on what you know. Then teach yourself or use flashcards. Anki is highly recommended, but consistency is key: "<em>Either do Anki every day or don't do it</em>…if you are not doing it consistently every day, it kinda beats the purpose." Many IMGs use Anki for daily reviews of that day's subjects rather than cramming it all at once. Use spaced repetition not just for facts, but to regularly revisit weak spots (build an Anki deck while doing Qbank or reading).</p>

<p><strong>Question banks:</strong> Practice questions are <em>gold</em>. UWorld is the gold-standard Qbank (paid). Students stress using it as a learning tool: annotate First Aid with every explanation and review notes. Aim to complete UWorld at least once fully. For beginners or low-budget, consider free/cheaper Qs: NBME practice forms (older sets), USMLE-Rx (if on discount), or community-shared NBME Q's for initial learning (but always cross-check answers). NBME self-assessments (e.g. NBME 16, 17, etc) and the free 120 at Prometric are critical for benchmarking. One IMG noted "Combined with the free 120, [NBME tests] were the most representative… much better than UWorld practice tests." Always mimic exam conditions (timed, no breaks).</p>

<p><strong>First Aid &amp; Pathoma:</strong> First Aid (FA) is your Step 1 "bible". Use it as a skeleton: write summary notes in the margins or annotate with memorable charts. Watch <strong>Pathoma</strong> videos (Dr. Sattar's pathology) – "they only take about 2 days if you commit… and they are amazing." Pathoma reinforces pathology concepts and comes with a concise book; it's nearly essential (paid, but some students find PDF copies or video notes). A systematic approach: go through FA + Pathoma <strong>per system</strong> (e.g. cardio, pulm), then do all related UWorld Qs.</p>

<p><strong>Sketchy &amp; Other Visuals:</strong> SketchyMicro and SketchyPharm (paid) are popular for microbial/pharm mnemonics. If budget is tight, try free alternatives: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DirtyMedicine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirty Medicine</a></strong> (YouTube) for micro/biochem visual mnemonics, or <strong>Randy Neil (Medicosis)</strong> YouTube videos for pharmacology basics (free lectures). Some students prefer other styles: one IMG says Sketchy "I can't stand how Sketchy teaches… I used it once and never again" – find what works for you (pixorize, Ninja Nerd, Armando Hasudungan drawings, or class notes).</p>

<p><strong>Boards &amp; Beyond (BnB):</strong> These video lectures are highly regarded (paid). If you have access, BnB covers physiology/pathology in detail. Otherwise, free lectures like <strong>Osmosis</strong>, <strong>Khan Academy</strong>, or <strong>Lecturio</strong> can substitute for many topics. Also consider <strong>online forums and blogs</strong> for clarifications (e.g. Reddit threads, such as a community QnA on AnKing or Step 1 on r/medicalschool).</p>

<p><strong>Making your own notes:</strong> Many IMGs recommend taking notes actively. Examples: write down tough facts, draw diagrams, or use a "UWorld notebook" for facts seen in questions. Summarize each subject in your own words. Study groups or peer teaching (even virtual) can help reinforce learning – explaining concepts to others is powerful active recall.</p>

<p><strong>Study Groups &amp; Community:</strong> Join IMG-friendly groups (WhatsApp, Facebook, Discord) for study partners or moral support. Many find Reddit (r/step1, r/IMGreddit, r/medicalschool, etc.) useful for advice and resources (though filter for quality). One student wrote on Reddit, "the internet is vast… use free resources for your prep." Community Qbanks (like Free 120) and free question collections can stretch your practice.</p>

<p>Below is a snapshot of key resources (free and paid). Use this to pick tools that fit your budget and style.</p>

<div id="practice-exams"></div>

<h2>Question Banks &amp; Practice Exams</h2>

<p><strong>Practice Exam Strategy:</strong> Use NBME self-assessments to track progress. IMGs often take <strong>NBME 16–30</strong> before exam day; treat them like real tests (timed, no help). One IMG noted that NBME+free120 felt "much better than UWorld practice tests" for mimicking real exam style. Aim for NBME scores above ~60–70% in dedicated study phase; as one student put it, "Step 1 is doable… if you have NBME scores ~60-70%, just take the test – you're more ready than you think." Use your NBME trends to identify weak areas.</p>

<p><strong>Free 120 at Prometric:</strong> Everyone should take the free Prometric Practice 120 in a center if possible (especially if prone to anxiety). It's free and simulates the environment. One IMG did it as a "first time in a place like that" and found it "helped me a lot to feel comfortable on exam day."</p>

<p><strong>Interpreting Scores:</strong> For NBMEs, approximate Step 1 conversion charts exist (older, but trends hold). Generally, aim for 90+ on NBMEs to be safe for a 230+ score, but many IMGs reverse-engineer success: one scored 267 on Step 2 after passing Step 1 with NBMEs mostly in the 70s. Don't obsess over a single NBME; look for upward trend and ensure no major gaps.</p>

<p><strong>Simulate Test Conditions:</strong> Do blocks of 40–50 questions in a row under timed conditions to build stamina ("study 8–9 hours a day… Step 1 IS a long test"). Use the Prometric tutorial and practice materials to avoid surprises. On test day, apply the common strategy: read until ~15 seconds, if still stumped, mark it and move on (one IMG cautioned "if you can't decode in ~15s, flag and move on… freezing kills momentum").</p>

<div id="ecfmg-registration"></div>

<h2>Registration &amp; Logistics (International Students)</h2>

<p><strong>ECFMG Certification:</strong> All non-US grads must get <a href="https://www.ecfmg.org/2026ib/eligibility-usmle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ECFMG certified</a> before Step 1. For <strong>students</strong>, your school must verify you've finished basic science coursework by exam time. For <strong>graduates</strong>, ECFMG verifies your medical diploma with the school. Start ECFMG registration ASAP (one-time fee <a href="https://academically.com/blogs/usmle-step-1-exam-fees-and-additional-costs-in-2026-complete-breakdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">~$160</a>) since verification can take months.</p>

<p><strong>USMLE Application &amp; Prometric:</strong> <a href="https://www.usmle.org/apply-exams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apply for Step 1</a> via the FSMB (if outside US) through ECFMG. 2026 fees: <strong>$695</strong> exam fee + region surcharge <strong>$205</strong> (overseas). Use the official USMLE site to pay and get your scheduling permit. Then schedule your test at a local <a href="https://achievable.me/exams/usmle-step-1/resources/mastering-usmle-step-1-tips-for-international-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prometric center</a>. Prometric centers are in major cities worldwide; COVID guidelines may still apply (wear masks or show vaccination if required, check with center).</p>

<p><strong>Required Documents:</strong> Bring your <a href="https://www.usmle.org/what-to-know/exam-day-information/admission-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scheduling permit and valid ID</a> on test day. For IMGs, bring your <strong>passport</strong> (the name must <em>exactly match</em> the permit). It's wise to bring a <a href="https://elitemedicalprep.com/what-to-bring-to-your-step-1-exam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backup ID</a> (driver's license). No other IDs (expired, credit cards, etc) are allowed. If you forget the permit or ID, you won't be admitted (and will owe a rescheduling fee).</p>

<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Aim to <a href="https://www.usmle.org/what-to-know/exam-day-information/admission-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrive 30+ minutes early</a>. If you're late by &gt;5 minutes, they may refuse entry (some had to reschedule and pay a fee). A practical tip: <a href="https://elitemedicalprep.com/what-to-bring-to-your-step-1-exam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visit the Prometric center</a> a few days before your exam day to plan your route and timing.</p>

<p><strong>Rescheduling/Cancellation:</strong> International <a href="https://www.usmle.org/reschedule-exam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reschedule fees</a> are strict. If you change &gt;45 days before, it's free. 31–45 days out, fee ~$35; 6–30 days, ~$100; within 5 days, a hefty <strong>$365</strong>. So plan carefully and cancel/reschedule as early as possible to save money. (For example, "most of these charges are avoidable with early planning.")</p>

<div id="financial-considerations"></div>

<h2>Financial Considerations</h2>

<p><strong>Exam &amp; Certification Costs:</strong> The Step 1 exam itself is pricey for IMGs. For 2026, total is about <strong>$1,225</strong> USD (that's $1,020 exam fee + $205 international surcharge). Add the one-time <a href="https://www.ecfmg.org/2026ib/eligibility-usmle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ECFMG fee (~$160)</a>. NBME practice tests cost ~$60–120 each. IMGs pay more than US students since credentials must be verified.</p>

<p><strong>Travel &amp; Lodging:</strong> If no test center is in your city, budget for travel. Even staying locally may require a hotel: many IMGs spend <strong>$300–$1,000</strong> on travel/food/lodging around exam time. Book early (peak slots fill). Consider sharing a room with a study partner to split costs.</p>

<p><strong>Study Resources Budget:</strong> High-yield materials can add up. Subscriptions: UWorld (~$400+), AMBOSS (if you use it), Pathoma or Sketchy books/videos ($100–300 total), review courses ($300–$1,500 optional). Good news: many top students manage with minimal paid resources by leveraging free options (Anki decks, Reddit Qbanks, free YouTube lectures). As one IMG quipped, "Step 1 is expensive…and cost of prep can really add up. The internet is vast with a lot of free resources."</p>

<div class="article-tip">
<p><strong>Cost-Saving Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only buy <em>high-yield</em> resources. You don't need to buy <em>everything</em> – focus on core (First Aid, one Qbank).</li>
<li>Borrow or share resources with classmates (fairly share subscriptions if possible).</li>
<li>Use library or free trial versions for supplemental videos (e.g. free Pathoma book, YouTube lectures).</li>
<li>Avoid expensive USMLE coaching unless absolutely needed.</li>
<li>Apply for any IMG scholarships from your school or ECFMG (few exist).</li>
<li>Keep a ~10% buffer for currency fluctuations if paying abroad.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Residency &amp; Visa Implications for IMGs</h2>

<p><strong>Step 1 Score Importance:</strong> Even though Step 1 is now Pass/Fail, a strong score still matters for IMGs. Programs often screen IMGs by Step 1 performance. A high pass-level (240+) can bolster your application, especially for competitive specialties. Conversely, a bare pass may raise questions, so aim to truly master content rather than just cram. Use Step 1 prep to build solid knowledge, which also helps Step 2.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline &amp; ERAS:</strong> Ideally, complete Step 1 by the summer before ERAS. <a href="https://www.ecfmg.org/2026ib/eligibility-usmle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ECFMG certification</a> (required for ERAS) is granted after you pass Step 1 and Step 2CK and have degrees verified. Missing key deadlines can delay applications. Plan so that you receive your Step 1 score before ERAS opens (usually Sept) for that match cycle. In practice, many IMGs take Step 1 by June–July of their final year and Step 2CK by early next year.</p>

<p><strong>ECFMG Certification:</strong> Without ECFMG certification, you cannot enter the Match. Certification requires passing Step 1, Step 2 CK, (and Step 2 CS if still required in 2026) and diploma verification. The timeline can take months, so apply for certification early after passing Step 1. Track your ECFMG status online. Delays (e.g. incomplete docs) can jeopardize your ability to list programs.</p>

<p><strong>Visa Considerations:</strong> Some residency programs sponsor visas (J-1, H-1B) for IMGs, but a few prioritize U.S. citizens/Permanent Residents. A strong Step 1 score (and US clinical experience) improves your chances to stand out. Having Step 1 passed (or done) also helps when seeking U.S. electives/clerkships, making your CV more competitive.</p>

<p><strong>Match Strategy:</strong> Treat Step 1 as part of your overall profile. Studying earlier can free time later for research or applications. Remember: Step 1 builds foundation – do NOT treat it as "just P/F"; a solid knowledge base will pay off in interviews and Step 2. Programs care about your USMLE history (even pass/fail will be noted), so a disciplined study approach is itself a positive signal.</p>

<div id="test-day-tips"></div>

<h2>Test-Day Tips</h2>

<h3>Before the Exam</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rest well:</strong> Try to get 7–8 hours of sleep. (One IMG resorted to 10mg melatonin but <em>couldn't sleep</em> – avoid stimulants or last-minute cramming.) The day before, "stop studying by noon and relax"; take a light walk or do a short workout to decompress. Plan something fun or relaxing the evening before as a mental reward.</li>
<li><strong>Prep logistics:</strong> Pack items the night before: <a href="https://www.usmle.org/what-to-know/exam-day-information/admission-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scheduling permit</a> (printed or on phone), <a href="https://elitemedicalprep.com/what-to-bring-to-your-step-1-exam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">passport + backup ID</a>, snacks (e.g. PB&amp;J, nuts, fruit) and water, prescriptions/OTC meds (pain relievers, antacids, allergy meds). A jacket for the testing room (cool A/C) is wise. Don't wear a watch or excessive jewelry. Avoid bringing notes – it adds stress. Charge electronics in case (though they're not used during blocks).</li>
<li><strong>Travel plan:</strong> Arrive at the center early (at least <a href="https://www.usmle.org/what-to-know/exam-day-information/admission-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 min before check-in</a>). If possible, do a dry run to the center (as above) to avoid traffic issues. The <a href="https://elitemedicalprep.com/what-to-bring-to-your-step-1-exam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elite Med Prep blog</a> suggests visiting 3 days ahead to check travel time. Pack a simple meal for lunch break (the Prometric center will store your snacks/drink in a locker – you have a 45 min lunch after block 4).</li>
</ul>

<h3>During the Exam</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time management:</strong> Each block is 60 minutes for 40 questions. Keep track of time but don't panic if you're a bit behind—use the optional breaks strategically. One IMG said he took <em>all</em> allotted break time (7–8 min between blocks, 30 min lunch) for mental rest.</li>
<li><strong>Approach questions:</strong> Read efficiently and use the 15-second rule: if a question isn't clear quickly, mark it and move on, then come back if time. Use process of elimination; sometimes second or third choice is correct. Beware of "experimental" unscored questions – if a question seems <em>impossibly</em> hard or off-topic, it might be experimental (don't obsess).</li>
<li><strong>Stay calm:</strong> Anxiety can kill performance. Remember the Reddit mantra: "you can't think clearly if you're constantly in fight-or-flight mode." Take slow breaths if nervous. One tip: do deep breathing or short meditation before each block during breaks. Eat a healthy lunch (sandwich, fruit) to keep glucose up. Avoid caffeine crashes – if you drink coffee, do so early and sip water during breaks.</li>
<li><strong>Flagging:</strong> Use flags judiciously. As one student noted, flag 15–20 Qs/block if unsure, but don't leave too many. Move quickly on hard ones and ensure you answer every question.</li>
</ul>

<h3>After the Exam</h3>

<p>Allow time for the exam day post-test slump. You may get a "Myocardial Infarction Discussion" or other test moment cartoon, then the result email 3–4 weeks later. Many feel uncertain immediately afterward – remember, feeling terrible does not predict outcome. One IMG said she only "felt I passed after a moment" and reminded herself that real exam often feels harder than UWorld.</p>

<div id="common-pitfalls"></div>

<h2>Common Pitfalls &amp; How to Avoid Them</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Passive learning:</strong> Don't just read/annotate without testing yourself. Reading FA or watching videos is <em>passive</em>. Always do questions or recite info after reading. Active recall (flashcards, teaching) is what cements knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Skipping weaknesses:</strong> IMGs often excel in some subjects and neglect others. Identify low scores early (via UWorld or practice tests) and address gaps. Use target resources (e.g. <em>Dirty Medicine</em> or Kaplan textbooks) for trouble spots.</li>
<li><strong>Qbank Misuse:</strong> Don't rush question banks. As one IMG advised, "UWorld is a learning tool – annotate and review each question, not just rush through it." Randomizing questions is good, but also do timed blocks to build pacing. Don't rely on question explanations as your only learning; pair them with review material.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring subjects:</strong> Some IMGs skip subjects like biochemistry or micro because they seem dry. This is risky: Step 1 still has questions on them. Cover basics via FA and supplementary videos or charts (e.g. <strong>Mehlman's Arrows PDF</strong> for enzymes/pharm).</li>
<li><strong>Misinterpreting practice scores:</strong> Don't obsess over small score differences. For example, if NBME jumps from 75% to 80%, it indicates improvement but not a proportional final score. Focus on <em>mastery</em>, not just numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Burnout:</strong> The biggest pitfall is burnout from overwork. "3-4 months is all you need. 12 months is depressingly long and you'll be just hurting yourself" – there's truth here. Over-studying can backfire. Schedule regular breaks, weekends off, short vacations or study-free days to reset. One student scheduled daily exercise and 8 hours sleep as non-negotiables.</li>
<li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Studying alone 100% can be lonely. Join online forums or study groups to stay motivated. Share tips (e.g. Slack/Discord) and vent fears. Sometimes just hearing "I failed one block, but passed Step" from others can relieve anxiety (common in r/step1).</li>

<h2>Mental Health &amp; Burnout Prevention</h2>

<p>Preparing for Step 1 is a marathon. Treat it like a <strong>job</strong>, but one that requires self-care.</p>

<blockquote><p>"You can't think clearly if you're constantly in fight-or-flight mode… protect your mental health like it's part of your study plan."</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Schedule breaks:</strong> Incorporate weekly rest days or light days. The reddit consensus: "aim for 6–8 months to avoid burnout… cram in as little time as possible." Take 5–10 minutes every hour to stretch or breathe.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Keep your body active. One IMG insisted on running or working out <em>4–5x/week</em> during prep. Another recommended at least an hour of daily exercise to maintain mental health and stamina. Simple walks or yoga between blocks can clear your mind.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Maintain a regular sleep schedule. Cramming all night before exams backfires. The night before the test, avoid screen time and wind down early. Some relax with a short meditation or soothing music.</li>
<li><strong>Healthy food:</strong> Eat balanced meals (proteins, veggies, fruits). Don't survive on coffee and junk. Blood sugar crashes worsen anxiety and focus.</li>
<li><strong>Mindset:</strong> Normalize stress – everyone feels it. One student reminded others: "you can't think clearly if you're constantly in fight-or-flight mode." If anxiety spikes, step away briefly. Talk to friends/family about your feelings. Write down worries and counter them logically (e.g. "even if I made mistakes, I reviewed them").</li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Engage with other students. Write a quick encouragement to yourself before bed ("I studied all topics today – small progress!"). Consider professional help if stress is overwhelming. Many schools offer counseling hotlines.</li>
<li><strong>Fun plans:</strong> Have a reward planned after the exam – a trip, a party, or even a simple movie night. As one IMG said, <em>"Plan a fun activity after Step 1! You have achieved something amazing…you need something fun afterwards as a reward."</em> Anticipating a break can keep you motivated during tough days.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real Student Experiences (Reddit &amp; YouTube)</h2>

<p>Hearing from others who've been there can be priceless. Below are summaries of advice from <strong>IMG students</strong> (linked to original posts or videos):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/14m8zwh/step_1_study_tips_by_an_img_from_turkey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>"Step 1 Study Tips – by an IMG from Turkey" (Reddit)</strong></a> – This comprehensive write-up emphasizes <em>6 months</em> of focused study, using core resources only. Key tips: use <strong>First Aid, Pathoma, Boards &amp; Beyond, Sketchy, UWorld</strong> (nothing obscure); <strong>treat UWorld as a learning tool</strong> and annotate FA (he kept a UWorld notebook); be consistent with Anki or skip it; <strong>start registration early</strong> (it took longer than expected); and <strong>build stamina</strong> by doing long study sessions. He also advises doing 3–4 NBMEs and the free 120 seriously.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IMGreddit/comments/1c0gkqm/usmle_step_1_12_month_study_plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>"USMLE Step 1 – 12 Month Study Plan" (r/IMGreddit)</strong></a> – In this thread, one user breaks down a full-year plan: cover biochemistry/immunology first, then systems in blocks, reserve the last 2 months for UWorld pass and practice exams. Other commenters debate "6 months vs 12 months": one insists "12 months is way too long… 6 months max for Step 1", another says "use as much time as you need… if need 12 months, use it." Takeaway: tailor the timeline to your endurance, but include regular review to avoid forgetting.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1na3ih2/step_1_experience_as_an_img_with_full_time_work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>"Step 1 Prep with Full-Time Work" (Reddit)</strong></a> – An IMG working 8h/day studied ~6–7h per day for <strong>10 months</strong>. He started with BnB+First Aid (Oct–Jan) then moved to <strong>40 UWorld Qs/day, Mon–Sat</strong>. He made Anki cards from wrong and doubtful Qs, often reviewing them during clinic downtime. He took NBMEs after 75% of UWorld, scored 77% on NBME 26 (his first), then set a test date. He used Prometric's free 120 to simulate test conditions. Key resources: UWorld, BnB, First Aid, DirtyMedicine, Mehlman PDFs, Randy Neil videos. In comments he adds: "Spaced repetition was key… even in last month, going over mistakes with Anki was super important."</li>

<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1pmnvjf/i_passed_step_1_as_a_nonus_img_what_mattered_more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>"Advice from a Non-US IMG"</strong></a> – This IMG's summary highlights big-picture mindset: don't panic if you plateau, trust that plateau = consolidation. Focus on <em>one concept per question</em>, not trivia. Stop overstudying minutiae; as he put it, "most Step 1 questions test one pivot concept (buzzwords)". For test-taking: "If I couldn't decode a question in ~15 seconds, I flagged it and moved on." He emphasizes stamina ("build it through practice tests") and, importantly, mental health: <em>"You can't think clearly if you're constantly in fight-or-flight mode… Step 1 became an obsession – fix how you think and protect your mental health like it's part of your study plan."</em></li>

<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1jydc95/is_it_realistic_to_do_step_1_in_3_months_advice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>"Step 1 in 3 Months – Reddit Q&amp;A"</strong></a> – A thread where IMGs discuss 3-month prep. Consensus: <em>only doable if fully dedicated.</em> "If you're studying full time then 3 months are doable, but if you have other responsibilities 3 months might be less." Suggestions: do <strong>40–80 Q/day</strong>, cover basics first, and use FA intensively. Otherwise, extend to 6+ months.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR29kGQBW4M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>"How to Study for USMLE Step 1 as an IMG – Only 4 Resources" (YouTube)</strong></a> – Dr. Chris (an MD and educator) strips resources to essentials: First Aid, UWorld, Pathoma, and one comprehensive video series (e.g. BnB). He advises starting UWorld early and integrating FA as you go. The emphasis is on quality over quantity: master these 4 before branching out.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb06TTkVKhU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>"USMLE Step 1 Tips for IMGs: Complete Plan" (YouTube, Sarthi Education)</strong></a> – Sarthi (an IMG-mentor) lays out a structured plan: pre-assessment (NBME baseline), 6-month study blocks, and frequent self-testing. He highlights using free resources like Boards &amp; Beyond Youtube snippets and practicing with NBME early on.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmDDHRtP9iU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>"The 6 Things Successful IMGs Do Differently" (YouTube, Alec Palmerton, MD)</strong></a> – Dr. Palmerton (a former IMG matcher) shares tips: <em>plan early</em>, <em>use high-yield sources</em>, <em>do many questions</em>, and <em>stay healthy</em>.
