Viral infection is the most frequent cause, but acute hepatitis can also result from drugs (especially acetaminophen overdose), toxins, ischemia, alcohol, or autoimmune disease, leading to elevated liver enzymes and often jaundice.","why_it_matters":"Very common worldwide and an important cause of morbidity. Hepatitis A is a leading cause of acute viral hepatitis (≈18,000 U.S. cases in 2019), and millions live with chronic hepatitis B/C. Severe acute hepatitis can progress to acute liver failure, which is often fatal – acetaminophen toxicity alone causes ~50% of U.S. acute liver failure cases. Mastering this topic helps in recognizing hepatitis early (e.g., interpreting serologies) and preventing complications or chronic disease.","how_youll_see_it":["Often initially asymptomatic or mild. Symptomatic cases classically have a prodrome of fatigue, malaise, nausea (± low fever) followed by an icteric phase: jaundice with dark urine, pale stool, and tender hepatomegaly. Right upper quadrant pain is common; some viruses (e.g., HBV) cause early arthralgias or rash (serum sickness-like).","Adults tend to have more overt symptoms than children. (E.g., adults with HAV usually develop jaundice, whereas infected young children often do not.) Acute HBV in neonates/children is often asymptomatic but has a high risk of chronic infection; adults with HBV are more symptomatic and usually clear the virus. Hepatitis C infection is usually mild or unnoticed acutely (≈80% have no jaundice) but frequently becomes chronic if untreated.","Viral hepatitis clues: think hepatitis A or E in a patient with recent travel to or ingestion of food/water from endemic areas; hepatitis B in those with blood or sexual exposure (IV drug use, unprotected sex, healthcare needle stick); hepatitis C in IV drug users or anyone with past transfusions (often subclinical acutely); EBV/CMV hepatitis in someone with a mononucleosis-like illness.","Non-viral causes: Drug-induced hepatitis may follow an overdose (e.g., acetaminophen causing fulminant necrosis) or an idiosyncratic reaction to a medication (common offenders: isoniazid, herbal supplements, amoxicillin–clavulanate). Alcoholic hepatitis classically presents in a heavy drinker with jaundice, fever, and tender hepatomegaly (AST is elevated but usually <300 U/L, with AST:ALT ~2:1). Autoimmune hepatitis can present acutely (especially in young women) with very high AST/ALT and immunologic markers (ANA, anti–smooth muscle, high IgG). Ischemic hepatitis (\"shock liver\") occurs after severe hypotension (e.g., septic shock, cardiac arrest), with extreme AST/ALT elevations (>1000) that rapidly improve as perfusion is restored."],"problem_solving":["Confirm hepatocellular injury: check AST/ALT (often strikingly elevated in acute hepatitis) and compare with alkaline phosphatase. Marked transaminase elevation with normal/mild ALP suggests hepatitis; if ALP is disproportionately high (cholestatic pattern), consider biliary obstruction instead of primary hepatitis.","Identify the cause: take a thorough history (travel, sexual contacts, IV drug use, recent medications or supplements, alcohol use, etc.). Test for viral markers – HAV IgM, HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc, HCV antibody (with reflex to RNA) – and obtain an acetaminophen level in all acute cases. If those are negative, consider autoimmune hepatitis labs (ANA, anti–smooth muscle antibody, IgG level) and others (e.g., Wilson disease screen if young, HEV IgM if travel to endemic areas).","Assess severity: evaluate liver synthetic function (check PT/INR and glucose) and watch for any mental status changes (hepatic encephalopathy). Acute liver failure is defined by acute hepatitis with encephalopathy and impaired coagulation (INR ≥1.5) – this requires ICU care and urgent transplant evaluation.","Imaging: obtain an abdominal ultrasound to exclude obstruction or other structural abnormalities if lab results suggest a cholestatic component or the diagnosis is unclear. Ultrasound can also assess hepatic blood flow (helpful if ischemic hepatitis or thrombosis is suspected).","Management overview: start N-acetylcysteine (NAC) immediately if acetaminophen toxicity is possible (do not wait for levels).

Always perform a quick fingerstick glucose check early – hypoglycemia is a fast, treatable cause of AMS.","Empiric reversible treatments: In an undifferentiated coma, consider the classic \"coma cocktail\". Give IV naloxone (in case of opioid overdose) and IV thiamine (if alcoholism or malnutrition is suspected) before giving IV dextrose (glucose). Thiamine prior to glucose can prevent precipitating Wernicke encephalopathy in thiamine-deficient patients, and dextrose treats potential hypoglycemia. These interventions can rapidly reverse common causes (opioids, hypoglycemia) if present, while you continue the workup.","History & collateral info: Gather any history available from EMS, family, or medical records.

Known substance use or medications (opiates, insulin, psychiatric meds, etc.)? Concurrent symptoms like headache, fever, vomiting, or chest pain? A patient with liver disease or kidney failure may have metabolic encephalopathy; a patient on multiple meds may have drug interactions causing AMS. Don't forget to ask about possible toxins or environmental exposures (e.g. CO exposure, illicit drugs).","Physical exam (head-to-toe): Do a thorough exam to find clues. Neuro exam is critical: check pupillary size/reactivity (pinpoint pupils suggest opioids; asymmetry may indicate stroke or herniation), assess reflexes and motor responses (posturing can signal severe brain injury, a flaccid patient with no response suggests deep coma or overdose). Look for meningitis signs (neck stiffness, rash), signs of head trauma (bruising, swelling, Battle's sign or raccoon eyes), or any focal deficits (e.g. unilateral weakness) that point to a structural CNS lesion. Inspect skin for track marks (IV drug use), jaundice (liver failure), or petechiae (sepsis). Listen to heart/lungs (arrhythmia or pneumonia can cause hypoxia and confusion). Use the AVPU or GCS scale to objectively note responsiveness (Alert, responds to Voice, to Pain, or Unresponsive). This exam helps differentiate diffuse encephalopathy (usually no focal deficits, more likely metabolic, toxic, or infectious causes) from focal neurologic problems (stroke, hemorrhage).","Diagnostic tests: Because the differential is broad, labs and imaging are often done in parallel with exam. Common initial labs: CBC (infection, anemia), electrolytes (especially Na, Ca – derangements can cause AMS), renal/liver function (uremia or hepatic encephalopathy), glucose (if not already done), arterial blood gas (for CO2 retention or acidosis), tox screen (drugs of abuse, medication levels), and possibly thyroid/adrenal labs if endocrine crisis is possible. If infection is suspected, get cultures (blood, urine) and a lumbar puncture for CSF analysis after imaging if needed. Head CT scan (non-contrast) is often one of the first imaging studies – indicated if any trauma, focal neurologic signs, or to rule out hemorrhage before doing an LP. In children, also consider head CT for non-accidental trauma. If CT is negative and no cause found, an EEG might be done to evaluate for non-convulsive seizures (sometimes patients are in subtle status epilepticus). Tailor further tests based on leads from history/exam (e.g. cortisol level for possible Addisonian crisis, ammonia level for unexplained encephalopathy, etc.).","Objective scoring tool: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is commonly used to quantify consciousness. It assesses Eye opening (E), Verbal response (V), and Motor response (M). Scores range from 3 (deep coma) to 15 (fully alert).

Untreated amblyopia can result in permanent vision loss in the affected eye.","why_it_matters":"Early detection is critical. The younger the child, the more visual plasticity they have – treatment before age ~7 (the critical period of visual development) offers the best chance of full vision correction. If not addressed in time, the vision loss becomes irreversible, impairing depth perception (stereopsis). It also leaves the child at risk: if the healthy eye later has an injury or disease, overall vision may be severely compromised.","how_youll_see_it":["Often picked up during routine vision screening in a toddler or preschooler, since children may not complain (the better eye covers for the weaker eye). Parents might notice nothing unusual, or sometimes a subtle eye misalignment (strabismus).","Kids with amblyopia might have poor depth perception (trouble with 3D vision) and may squint, shut one eye, or tilt their head to see better. In strabismic amblyopia, one eye may drift inward or outward (constant strabismus from an early age is a big risk).","Any condition that blurs or obstructs vision in one eye during early years can cause amblyopia. Common culprits: a misaligned eye (strabismus), a significant difference in refractive error between eyes (anisometropia), or visual deprivation (e.g. congenital cataract or severe ptosis blocking vision). The affected eye often looks normal on exam (no redness or obvious defect)."],"problem_solving":["Screen early: All children between ages 3–5 should have a vision check (acuity test or photo screening) at least once to catch amblyopia early.","Visual acuity testing: Check each eye separately using age-appropriate charts (pictures, tumbling E). A difference of ≥2 lines between the eyes (even after correcting refractive errors) is suggestive of amblyopia.","Cover-uncover test: Perform this to detect strabismus. Covering one eye and then uncovering can reveal a deviated eye refixating — strabismus is a common cause of amblyopia. If present, characterize it (e.g., constant vs intermittent).","Fundoscopic exam & red reflex: Always examine the red reflex and retina to rule out causes like cataract or retinoblastoma if one eye isn't seeing well.

Patching schedules vary by severity – mild amblyopia may only need ~2 hours/day patching, whereas severe cases may require most of the day.","Penalization: An alternative to patching is blurring the good eye with drops like atropine (typically 1% atropine on weekends or daily) to encourage use of the weak eye.

A true aneurysm involves all layers of the artery (intima, media, adventitia), whereas a pseudoaneurysm (false aneurysm) is a contained rupture where blood leaks out of the vessel lumen but is held by surrounding tissue. Shapes are described as saccular (one-sided pouch) or fusiform (circumferential bulge).","why_it_matters":"Aneurysms can grow silently and eventually rupture, causing life-threatening hemorrhage. They also can form clots that embolize or compress adjacent structures. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture, for example, is often fatal without immediate surgery. Cerebral aneurysm rupture causes subarachnoid hemorrhage, a dire stroke emergency. Recognizing risk factors and knowing when to intervene can save lives.","how_youll_see_it":["AAA (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm): Typically in older male smokers. Often asymptomatic until large. May be found incidentally or by a pulsatile abdominal mass on exam. Can cause deep abdominal or back pain if expanding. Rupture presents with sudden severe pain, hypotension, and collapse.","TAA (Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm): Often discovered incidentally (e.g., widened mediastinum on chest X-ray). Symptoms, if present, include chest or back pain and signs of compression: hoarseness (pressure on recurrent laryngeal nerve), cough/wheezing (tracheal compression), or dysphagia (esophageal compression). If the aneurysm involves the aortic root, it can cause an aortic regurgitation murmur or heart failure symptoms.","Cerebral (Berry) Aneurysm: Typically asymptomatic until rupture. Rupture causes subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with a sudden thunderclap headache (often described as the worst headache of life), stiff neck, vomiting, and possible loss of consciousness. Unruptured aneurysms usually cause no symptoms, but a larger one might press on cranial nerves (e.g., a posterior communicating artery aneurysm can cause a CN III palsy with a dilated pupil and ptosis).","Peripheral Aneurysms: Commonly affect the popliteal artery (behind the knee), often in older patients with AAA. May present as a pulsatile mass in the popliteal fossa or with leg pain from nerve compression. Often, however, they present when complications occur: a popliteal aneurysm can throw clots to the lower leg (acute limb ischemia) or thrombose and cause critical limb ischemia. Other peripheral aneurysms (femoral, carotid, visceral arteries) are usually detected incidentally or when they rupture or embolize."],"problem_solving":["Identify at-risk patients and screen appropriately: e.g., one-time abdominal ultrasound is recommended in men ≥65 who have ever smoked to detect AAA.","If an aneurysm is found, assess its size and growth rate via imaging. Small AAAs (e.g., <5 cm) are monitored periodically (ultrasound every 6–12 months depending on size), whereas larger aneurysms approach the threshold for repair. Likewise, an ascending TAA >5 cm in a Marfan patient might prompt surgery earlier than in others.","Optimize risk factor control: Strict blood pressure management (β-blockers often used in aortic disease), smoking cessation, and treatment of atherosclerosis (statins, etc.) help slow aneurysm expansion.","Refer to specialists when criteria are met: e.g., vascular surgery for large AAA or symptomatic aneurysms; neurosurgery for sizable or ruptured cerebral aneurysms. Also consider genetics referral if a young patient has a thoracic aneurysm (to evaluate for connective tissue disorders like Marfan or Loeys-Dietz).","In an acute setting (suspected rupture), act fast: a hypotensive patient with signs of ruptured AAA should go straight to emergent surgical intervention—do not delay for extensive imaging.

For AAA, repair is generally recommended at diameter ≥5.5 cm in men (≈5.0 cm in women) or if growing >0.5 cm in 6 months. For ascending TAA, ~5.5 cm is typical threshold (lower if connective tissue disorder or rapid growth). For cerebral aneurysms, many experts consider treatment if >7 mm (or smaller if located in high-risk locations or patient has prior hemorrhage). Popliteal aneurysms are often repaired when >2 cm to prevent limb ischemia.","Repair options: Open surgical repair involves replacing the diseased segment with a graft (e.g., open AAA repair via abdominal incision). Endovascular repair uses stent-grafts delivered via catheter (EVAR for AAA, TEVAR for descending TAA) – less invasive, shorter recovery, but may need future re-interventions. Cerebral aneurysms can be treated by endovascular coiling (filling the aneurysm with coils) or surgical clipping of the aneurysm neck; choice depends on aneurysm anatomy and patient factors.","Rupture management: This is a surgical emergency. Ruptured AAA → immediate hemorrhage control and surgical repair (often open surgery; EVAR if quickly available).

The lack of fetal renal function causes severe oligohydramnios (anhydramnios) leading to pulmonary hypoplasia, characteristic facies (Potter facies), and limb contractures. It is a uniformly fatal anomaly, usually resulting in stillbirth or death shortly after birth due to respiratory failure.","why_it_matters":"Bilateral renal agenesis is a rare but important congenital anomaly (historically ~1 in 3,000–5,000 births; ~1 in 8,000–9,000 pregnancies in the ultrasound era) with a strong male predominance (~3:1). It is the quintessential cause of the Potter oligohydramnios sequence, which is frequently tested in exams for its classic clinical findings. Early recognition on prenatal ultrasound is critical for parental counseling because the condition is incompatible with life. Notable associations include maternal pregestational diabetes and teratogen exposures (e.g., ACE inhibitors), and it often co-occurs with other anomalies (e.g., VACTERL association in ~50% of cases). There is an increased risk of renal anomalies in relatives (recurrence risk ~5%), and bilateral renal agenesis can be part of genetic syndromes like branchio-oto-renal, Fraser syndrome, or sirenomelia.","how_youll_see_it":["Routine mid-trimester prenatal ultrasound shows severe oligohydramnios with non-visualization of fetal kidneys and an empty bladder.","Pregnant patient presents with markedly low fundal height; ultrasound confirms anhydramnios and absence of both fetal kidneys (Potter sequence).","Newborn (often male) with Potter facies (flattened nose, recessed chin, low-set ears), limb contractures (clubbed feet), and immediate respiratory distress; no urine output is observed and imaging/postmortem reveals bilateral renal agenesis."],"problem_solving":["First-line diagnostic approach is prenatal ultrasound: look for absent kidneys in the renal fossae (and no ectopic kidney), absent bladder filling, and measure amniotic fluid index (AFI). Color Doppler can help by showing absence of renal arteries (normally arising from the aorta), and the 'lying-down adrenal sign' may suggest an empty renal fossa.","If ultrasound is inconclusive due to poor visualization (because anhydramnios limits imaging), a fetal MRI can be used for confirmation of renal absence and to look for any renal tissue or alternate causes of oligohydramnios.","Once bilateral renal agenesis is confirmed, evaluate for other anomalies or syndromic features. A detailed anatomy scan (and possibly fetal echocardiogram) is warranted, as up to half of cases have other malformations (e.g., vertebral, cardiac, gastrointestinal). Consider genetic testing (karyotype or microarray) since aneuploidy is present in ~7%.","Provide prompt counseling to the expectant parents. Emphasize that bilateral renal agenesis is uniformly fatal due to lung underdevelopment (pulmonary hypoplasia). Discussion should include the option of pregnancy termination (if early enough) versus continuation with palliative care planning. Psychological support is important given the grim prognosis.","There is no curative treatment available. Experimental interventions such as serial amnioinfusions during pregnancy (to mitigate pulmonary hypoplasia) have shown some prolonged survival in small trials, but these infants still require immediate dialysis and have high mortality. In standard practice, management is supportive: if the fetus is carried to term, plan for comfort care after delivery (oxygen/ventilation for a brief period if needed, but typically intensive interventions are futile without kidneys)."],"tricks":["Mnemonic for Potter sequence: **POTTER** – **P**ulmonary hypoplasia, **O**ligohydramnios, **T**wisted (wrinkled) skin, **T**wisted face (Potter facies: flat nose, low-set ears, micrognathia), **E**xtremity deformities (clubbed feet, contracted limbs), **R**enal agenesis (bilateral).","Imaging pearl: The **lying-down adrenal sign** on fetal ultrasound – in the absence of kidneys, the adrenal glands appear flattened and oriented longitudinally in the renal fossae.

If a question stem involves a male fetus with severe oligohydramnios, think of posterior urethral valves (if bladder is enlarged) versus bilateral renal agenesis (if bladder is absent).","Risk factors: Maternal conditions like **diabetes mellitus** (pre-gestational), **obesity**, **smoking**, and heavy alcohol use (especially binge drinking in early pregnancy) are associated with increased risk of bilateral renal agenesis. Avoidance of ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs in pregnancy is also crucial, as they can cause renal failure and Potter-like sequence.","Recurrence and relatives: Although usually sporadic, there is ~5% recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies and up to 15% of first-degree relatives may have some form of renal anomaly (like unilateral agenesis). Families with a history of bilateral renal agenesis should receive genetic counseling and early prenatal ultrasounds in future pregnancies."],"exam_appearance":["A 20-week prenatal ultrasound shows almost no amniotic fluid and an inability to visualize the fetal kidneys or bladder.

It causes lifelong functional limitations but is **non-degenerative**, meaning many patients live into adulthood. Early recognition and therapy can greatly improve outcomes. CP frequently appears on exams as a cause of developmental delay and abnormal muscle tone in infants.","how_youll_see_it":["Signs usually emerge in infancy: **delayed motor milestones** (e.g., not sitting by ~8 mo, not walking by ~15–18 mo), abnormal muscle tone (initial hypotonia evolving into spasticity or persistent stiffness), and persistence of **primitive reflexes** (e.g., Moro or asymmetric tonic neck reflex beyond 6 mo).","**Spastic CP** (≈80% of cases): characterized by **hypertonia**, **hyperreflexia**, and velocity-dependent resistance (\"clasp-knife\" spasticity).

Facial involvement can cause grimacing or dysarthria.","**Ataxic CP** (~5%): due to cerebellar damage. Features include **poor coordination**, balance issues, and an **ataxic gait** (wide-based, unsteady). Fine motor tasks are difficult, and there may be intention tremor. These children appear shaky and have trouble with rapid or precise movements.","Many patients have a **mixed** type (combining spastic and dyskinetic features, etc.).

A **CRH stimulation test** is another tool: pituitary adenomas respond with a rise in ACTH/cortisol, but ectopic ACTH tumors show no response.","Once lab results suggest a source, use imaging to find it.

Considered part of the spondyloarthritis family (seronegative, HLA-B27 associated in many axial cases).","why_it_matters":"Up to 20% of IBD patients develop arthritis, making it the most common extra-intestinal manifestation. Recognizing this link is important: treating the underlying IBD often improves the joint symptoms. On exams, a vignette might describe a patient with ulcerative colitis now with knee pain, or a Crohn's patient with back stiffness – both pointing to enteropathic arthritis.","how_youll_see_it":["Patient with known **ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease** who develops joint issues. Two patterns: (1) **Peripheral arthritis**: typically an **asymmetric oligoarthritis** of large joints (knees, ankles, hips). Often coincides with IBD flares (active diarrhea, abdominal pain). Usually non-erosive and migratory. (2) **Axial arthritis**: chronic **sacroiliitis** and spondylitis like AS; this can occur independently of bowel disease activity (may even precede IBD diagnosis).","Peripheral enteropathic arthritis (sometimes called Type 1) often flares in parallel with IBD and remits when IBD is controlled. It tends to be self-limited and usually does not cause long-term joint damage. **Enthesitis** can also occur (e.g., heel pain).","Axial disease (Type 2) in IBD behaves like ankylosing spondylitis: inflammatory back pain, morning stiffness, possible progression to vertebral fusion. About 50% or more of IBD patients with spondylitis are **HLA-B27 positive**. Axial involvement does not necessarily correlate with IBD flares – it may progress even when gut symptoms are quiescent.","Other features: IBD patients may have other extra-intestinal manifestations (which can co-occur with arthritis), e.g., **erythema nodosum**, **pyoderma gangrenosum**, **uveitis**. These clues might appear in a question to hint at the IBD context.","Important: prolonged NSAID use for arthritis can **worsen IBD** (NSAIDs can trigger flares), so management has to balance joint and gut treatment."],"problem_solving":["In an IBD patient with joint pain, first determine if it's **peripheral vs axial** (or both). Take a thorough history of back symptoms and examine the spine/SI joints, not just the peripheral joints.","Assess IBD activity: if arthritis coincides with a flare of bowel symptoms, it's likely peripheral enteropathic arthritis. The main strategy is to **control the IBD** (which often alleviates the joint issues).","Imaging: if axial symptoms, do an **X-ray of the SI joints** (or MRI if early) to check for sacroiliitis. If they have typical AS changes, they essentially have ankylosing spondylitis in the context of IBD. If only peripheral joints, X-rays are usually normal (enteropathic peripheral arthritis is typically non-erosive).","Lab: No specific diagnostic test. Inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) might be elevated (though that could be from active IBD). HLA-B27 testing might be positive in axial cases (less so in purely peripheral cases).","Always review the medication list: avoid chronic high-dose **NSAIDs** as they can exacerbate IBD (NSAIDs often trigger flares). If needed for short term, consider adding gastroprotection.

Do a **digital rectal exam**: assess resting tone (internal sphincter) and squeeze tone (external sphincter strength), check for rectal masses or hard stool (impaction).

If constipation is present, check for fecal impaction (DRE) and relieve it with laxatives or enemas, then institute a bowel regimen to prevent re-accumulation.","Order specialized tests if the cause remains unclear or for severe cases: **Anorectal manometry** measures anal sphincter pressures and rectal sensation (helps detect weak sphincters or poor sensation). **Endoanal ultrasound** (or pelvic MRI) visualizes the integrity of the internal/external sphincter muscles (e.g., detecting an occult sphincter tear). **Defecography** (dynamic imaging during simulated defecation) can reveal functional problems like prolapse or rectocele.

Gallstone complications and classic risk factors frequently appear on exams.","how_youll_see_it":["**Biliary colic** (symptomatic cholelithiasis): episodic RUQ or epigastric pain, often postprandial (especially after a fatty meal). Pain is steady, severe, may radiate to the right shoulder/back (phrenic nerve referral), and typically lasts <6 hours then resolves as the stone falls back. Between episodes, patient feels well; labs are usually normal.","**Acute cholecystitis**: gallstone prolongedly obstructs the cystic duct, causing gallbladder inflammation.

Patients often have leukocytosis and mild ↑bilirubin or ALP; gallbladder may be palpable. Untreated, can progress to gallbladder empyema or perforation.","**Choledocholithiasis & Cholangitis**: stone in the common bile duct causes obstructive **jaundice** (↑direct bilirubin, ALP) and sometimes pancreatitis. **Ascending cholangitis** (infection of biliary tree) classically presents with **Charcot triad**: RUQ pain + fever + jaundice (add hypotension & confusion = Reynolds pentad).

In acute cholecystitis, ultrasound may also show gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. A **HIDA scan** (cholescintigraphy) can confirm cholecystitis by showing non-filling of the gallbladder. **MRCP** or **ERCP** can visualize and retrieve CBD stones.

Check **liver enzymes**: a cholestatic pattern (↑ALP, ↑bilirubin) points to a CBD stone. Check **pancreatic enzymes** if pancreatitis is suspected.","In suspected gallstone disease, ultrasound is the best initial test. If ultrasound is equivocal and suspicion remains for cystic duct obstruction, do a **HIDA scan** (non-visualization of gallbladder = positive for cholecystitis). For possible choledocholithiasis, use MRCP or endoscopic ultrasound for diagnosis if intermediate probability, or go straight to ERCP if high probability (e.g., visible CBD stone on imaging or cholangitis).","Distinguish biliary pain from other causes: Biliary colic often comes on after eating and is intense but transient.

Unlike natural selection (which is non-random and based on an allele's effect on survival/reproduction), genetic drift is <u>random</u> - alleles can become more or less common simply by luck. Genetic drift tends to have a larger impact in <u>small populations</u>.","tips":["Two special cases of genetic drift are often discussed: **<u>bottleneck effect</u>** (when a population's size is dramatically reduced by a random disaster, the surviving gene pool may have different allele frequencies) and **<u>founder effect</u>** (when a small group colonizes a new area, the alleles in this \"founder\" group may not represent the original population's diversity, so the new population's allele frequencies drift from the original). Both are examples of drift because the changes in allele frequencies are due to <u>chance sampling of individuals</u>.","Genetic drift can lead to <u>loss of genetic variation</u>. By chance, some alleles can be completely lost (frequency goes to 0) and others can become fixed (reach 100% frequency) in a population. This is more likely in <u>small populations</u> where random fluctuations loom larger.","Exam tip: Genetic drift is often contrasted with natural selection. A question might describe a scenario where a disaster randomly kills a portion of a population regardless of their traits - that scenario is <u>genetic drift</u> (not selection). Or if a question asks why a small isolated population shows big allele frequency swings generation to generation, the answer is the <u>randomness of genetic drift</u>."],"exam_appearance":["Be prepared for questions about the **<u>founder effect</u>** or **<u>bottleneck effect</u>**, which are applications of genetic drift.

If it emphasizes an advantageous trait spreading, that's natural selection, not drift.","Remember that drift can oppose or override natural selection in some cases, especially in very small populations.

Common end-stage complication of chronic liver diseases (HBV, HCV, alcohol, etc.), so recognizing early signs in at-risk patients (cirrhosis) can enable potentially curative treatment (resection or transplant).

Larger or advanced HCC causes **weight loss**, **RUQ pain**, and signs of liver decompensation (new-onset **ascites**, jaundice, or variceal bleeding) in someone with chronic liver disease.","**Risk factors**: Present in 80–90% of **cirrhosis** cases. Chronic **hepatitis B** and **C** are the most common causes worldwide (HBV can cause HCC even *without* cirrhosis). Other major etiologies: heavy **alcohol** use, **non-alcoholic fatty liver disease** (NASH/NAFLD), hereditary **hemochromatosis** (iron overload). In certain regions, **aflatoxin B1** exposure (from Aspergillus mold on food) induces a p53 mutation and greatly increases HCC risk (especially with concurrent HBV).","Patients may show a rising **AFP** (alpha-fetoprotein) level, which is a tumor marker for HCC (often elevated when tumors are larger; very high AFP is strongly suggestive, though HCC can occur with normal AFP). Physical exam can reveal hepatomegaly or a hepatic mass; a hepatic **bruit** may be heard due to tumor vascularity. Rare paraneoplastic features include **polycythemia** (from erythropoietin production) or hypoglycemia."],"problem_solving":["**Surveillance**: Any patient with cirrhosis (or high-risk HBV carrier) should undergo surveillance every 6 months (ultrasound ± AFP) to detect HCC at an early stage.","**Imaging diagnosis**: If a liver nodule is found, perform a contrast **triple-phase CT** or dynamic MRI of the liver. HCC classically shows **arterial phase hyperenhancement** and **portal venous (or delayed) phase washout** relative to the surrounding liver. This imaging pattern in a high-risk patient is considered diagnostic of HCC (no biopsy needed in typical cases, avoiding needle tract seeding).","If imaging findings are **not classic** or the patient is not known to have cirrhosis, obtain a **liver biopsy** for definitive diagnosis (histology). Biopsy is also indicated for nodules that are indeterminate by imaging (e.g. LI-RADS category 4 or \"materializing\" lesions) to distinguish HCC from benign lesions or other malignancies.","Always check **AFP** levels when evaluating a liver mass in a cirrhotic patient. An elevated AFP supports the diagnosis (and very high AFP often indicates more advanced disease), but a normal AFP does not rule out HCC. AFP can also be followed over time (rising AFP in a cirrhotic is worrisome for HCC).","Once HCC is diagnosed, **stage** the disease and assess liver function to guide therapy. Staging systems like **BCLC** incorporate tumor features (size, number, vascular invasion, metastases), **Child-Pugh** score (underlying liver function), and performance status.

This explains the high HCC incidence in some low-resource settings despite younger age.","**Imaging mnemonic**: \"**Arterial in, portal out**\" – HCC lesions light up with contrast in arterial phase and then **wash out** (become hypodense) on portal/delayed phases. Benign hypervascular lesions (like focal nodular hyperplasia or adenoma) may enhance early but typically **do not wash out**, which helps tell them apart.","HCC is one of the few cancers often diagnosed **non-invasively** – if a cirrhotic patient's imaging meets strict criteria, you **skip biopsy** and treat.

These are also used as bridge therapies while awaiting transplant.","If **intermediate stage** (multifocal disease confined to liver, no vascular invasion, good liver function): use loco-regional palliative therapy like **TACE** (transarterial chemoembolization). TACE involves injecting chemotherapy (or radioembolic beads) into the hepatic artery feeding the tumor and embolizing it, to shrink tumors and prolong survival. TACE is contraindicated in advanced liver failure (Child C) or main portal vein thrombosis due to risk of liver necrosis.","If **advanced stage** (tumor invades blood vessels or has distant metastases, or patient has poorer liver function): **systemic therapy** is indicated.

Also, any HCC >5 cm, or multifocal tumors, or the presence of vascular invasion/extrahepatic spread are poor prognostic signs.","**Bone pain** in a patient with known HCC → suspect **bone metastases** (common metastatic site along with lung); new cough or chest lesions might indicate lung metastases.

Inguinal hernias account for ~75% of all abdominal wall hernias and are up to 10× more common in males (lifetime risk ≈27% in men). These hernias are high-yield for exams because they test knowledge of groin anatomy (differences between direct vs. indirect hernias, the inguinal canal, Hesselbach's triangle, etc.).

Patients often report a heaviness or dull discomfort in the groin, especially after activity, but many hernias are **painless** unless complications develop.","**Indirect hernias** can present in infants or young adults as a groin mass that may extend into the scrotum (in a baby boy, a swelling extending into the scrotum when crying is classic). **Direct hernias** usually occur in older adults as a bulge in the medial groin (through the abdominal wall) and **rarely protrude into the scrotum**. Large longstanding hernias of either type can enlarge over time and become disfiguring.","If the hernia becomes **incarcerated** (trapped), patients develop pain and an **irreducible** bulge. Bowel obstruction can occur if a loop of intestine is trapped (leading to nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension). **Strangulation** (compromised blood supply) causes severe pain at the hernia, tenderness, and overlying skin changes (erythema); patients may have fever or other systemic signs. Strangulated hernias are surgical emergencies."],"problem_solving":["**Examine upright:** Inspect and palpate the inguinal region with the patient standing and coughing (Valsalva) to accentuate a hernia. If a bulge is felt, attempt to gently reduce it. In males, invaginate a finger into the scrotum to feel the external ring from inside; a hernia impulse against the fingertip confirms the diagnosis.","**Deep ring test:** To distinguish direct vs. indirect, reduce the hernia and then occlude the internal (deep) inguinal ring (just above the midpoint of the inguinal ligament). Have the patient cough: if no bulge now appears, the hernia was indirect (coming through the deep ring); if a bulge still occurs medial to your finger, it's a direct hernia.","Use **imaging** if the diagnosis is unclear. An **ultrasound** can confirm an occult groin hernia and differentiate it from other causes of a mass (e.g. lymph node, femoral hernia). In women, who have a broader differential for groin masses, imaging is often needed for diagnosis. A **CT/MRI** can also identify hidden hernias or distinguish incisional vs. groin hernias in complex cases.","Differentiate an inguinal hernia from a **femoral hernia** by location: inguinal hernias protrude **above the inguinal ligament** (closer to the pubic tubercle), whereas femoral hernias present as a lump **below the inguinal ligament** in the upper thigh/groin crease. Femoral hernias carry a higher risk of strangulation.","In pediatric patients, distinguish an inguinal hernia from a **hydrocele**. A hydrocele (fluid around the testis) will **transilluminate** with light and you can usually feel the testis separate from the fluid; an inguinal hernia contains bowel and therefore will not transilluminate and often makes the testis difficult to distinguish.

If both substances move in the same direction across the membrane, it's called a **<u>symporter</u>**; if they move in opposite directions, it's an **<u>antiporter</u>** (exchanger). These carriers rely on the gradient of one ion (often Na+) to power the movement of another substance.","A classic example: the **<u>sodium-glucose cotransporter</u>** in intestinal cells. As Na+ ions flow passively into the cell (down their concentration gradient established by the Na+/K+ pump), glucose is dragged in with them, against glucose's gradient. This allows cells to absorb glucose efficiently even when it's more concentrated inside than outside.","Another example: the **<u>sodium-calcium exchanger</u>** (an antiporter in cardiac muscle cells). It uses the inward flow of Na+ (down its gradient) to expel Ca2+ from the cell against the Ca2+ gradient, helping regulate intracellular calcium levels. Importantly, if the Na+ gradient dissipates (e.g., if Na+/K+ ATPase is poisoned), secondary active transport will stop because its energy source is gone."],"exam_appearance":["If an exam question describes a transport protein that <u>does not directly use ATP</u> but instead uses \"the sodium gradient\" or another ion gradient to move a different molecule, that is <u>secondary active transport</u>. Key phrases include \"cotransport\" or \"coupled transport\".","For instance, a question might ask how glucose is absorbed from the gut lumen into intestinal cells against a concentration gradient: the answer is via <u>Na+-glucose symport</u> (a secondary active transport mechanism that uses the Na+ gradient).","Distinguish from primary active transport: if the question highlights a pump breaking down ATP (like Na+/K+ ATPase), that's primary. If it highlights one solute's gradient driving another's uptake or export, that's secondary. An example scenario: calcium ions being removed from a cell by swapping with incoming sodium ions - this is <u>secondary active transport</u> (the Na+ gradient, set up by ATP elsewhere, drives Ca2+ out)."],"see_also":[],"sources":[{"title":"StatPearls - Physiology, Active Transport (primary vs secondary)","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547718/"},{"title":"Khan Academy - Active transport (secondary active transport section)","url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/membranes-and-transport/active-transport/a/active-transport"},{"title":"PhysiologyWeb - Secondary Active Transport (overview)","url":"http://www.physiologyweb.com/lecture_notes/membrane_transport/secondary_active_transport.html"}]},{"id":"secondary-hyperparathyroidism","names":["Secondary hyperparathyroidism"],"aliases":["renal hyperparathyroidism","reactive hyperparathyroidism"],"abbr":["SHPT"],"patterns":["secondary hyperparathyroidism","secondary HPT","renal osteodystrophy"],"primary_tag":"endocrine","tags":["pathology","endocrine","renal"],"definition":"Excess PTH production secondary to chronic hypocalcemia (or hyperphosphatemia).

It is characterized by hypotension (e.g., systolic BP <90 or MAP <65) and signs of poor perfusion (altered mental status, oliguria, cool clammy skin, lactic acidosis).","why_it_matters":"Shock can rapidly progress to multi-organ failure and death if not recognized and treated immediately. It's a core emergency scenario and a common feature in exam cases (e.g., trauma, sepsis, MI), requiring prompt identification of the shock type and appropriate management to save the patient.","how_youll_see_it":["General shock features: patients typically present with hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Mental status is often altered (agitation, confusion). Skin is usually cold, pale, and clammy due to vasoconstriction, except in distributive shock where it may be warm/flushed. Oliguria (low urine output) and elevated blood lactate are red flags for tissue hypoperfusion.","Hypovolemic shock: look for history of fluid loss (e.g., trauma hemorrhage, GI bleed, severe vomiting/diarrhea, burns). Exam shows flat neck veins, dry mucous membranes, and cold extremities; blood pressure is low with narrow pulse pressure. Patients are often tachycardic and diaphoretic; there may be obvious external bleeding or an abdominal distension (internal bleeding).","Cardiogenic shock: often follows an acute myocardial infarction or decompensated heart failure. Clues include jugular venous distension (JVD), pulmonary edema (crackles on lung exam, orthopnea), and an S3 gallop. Extremities are cold and mottled. Patients may have chest pain or signs of acute MI. Blood pressure is very low, and tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias might be present as contributing factors.","Obstructive shock: suspect when there is a mechanical block to cardiac output. Cardiac tamponade presents with Beck's triad (hypotension, JVD, muffled heart sounds) and often pulsus paradoxus; tension pneumothorax causes distended neck veins, tracheal deviation, unilateral absent breath sounds, and acute respiratory distress; massive pulmonary embolism presents with sudden dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia, hypotension, and JVD with clear lungs. All lead to acute circulatory collapse if not rapidly relieved.","Distributive shock: think of conditions causing severe vasodilation and relative hypovolemia. In septic shock (most common distributive type), patients have infection signs (fever, possible source of infection) and may initially have warm, flushed skin with bounding pulses (high output \"warm shock\"), later becoming cold if worsening. Anaphylactic shock occurs after an allergen exposure (e.g., bee sting, drug) with bronchospasm (wheezing), rash (urticaria), angioedema, and hypotension. Neurogenic shock (e.g., spinal cord injury above T4) presents with hypotension and bradycardia (no reflex tachycardia) and warm skin due to loss of sympathetic tone."],"problem_solving":["Always assess ABCs first: secure the airway and ensure adequate breathing (supplemental O₂, consider intubation if needed). Start IV fluid resuscitation with crystalloids (unless obvious cardiogenic shock) and place the patient in a supine position to improve brain perfusion. Obtain IV access (2 large-bore IVs) and basic labs (including lactate) while beginning resuscitation.","Use clinical exam and bedside ultrasound (POCUS) to differentiate shock types. Check the neck veins: flat veins suggest low preload (hypovolemic or distributive), while distended veins suggest pump failure or obstruction (cardiogenic or obstructive). Examine for signs like muffled heart sounds (tamponade), unilateral breath sounds (tension pneumothorax), or focal infection (sepsis). Perform a FAST ultrasound exam in trauma for internal bleeding and echo for cardiac function/tamponade.","Remember classic hemodynamic profiles (e.g., from a Swan-Ganz catheter or echo estimates): Hypovolemic: ↓ CVP/PCWP (preload), ↓ CO, ↑ SVR (compensatory vasoconstriction); Cardiogenic: ↑ CVP/PCWP, ↓ CO, ↑ SVR; Obstructive: ↑ CVP (and ↑ PCWP in tamponade), ↓ CO, ↑ SVR; Distributive: ↓ CVP/PCWP, ↑ CO (early septic) or ↓ CO (late), ↓ SVR. These parameters guide therapy (e.g., need for fluids vs pressors).","Don't delay definitive interventions once a likely cause is identified. For example, if tamponade is suspected, perform pericardiocentesis emergently; if tension pneumothorax, do immediate needle decompression; if massive hemorrhage, initiate rapid transfusion and surgical intervention. In septic shock, obtain cultures and start broad-spectrum antibiotics within the first hour.

Trend vital signs and urine output; may require massive transfusion protocol in trauma.","Cardiogenic shock: support the pump. Give inotropic agents (e.g., dobutamine or epinephrine) to improve cardiac output and vasopressors (norepinephrine) if needed for BP. Treat the underlying cause (e.g., urgent revascularization for MI, repair mechanical complications like valve rupture or septal defect). Use fluids cautiously – small bolus if needed, but avoid overload (consider diuretics if pulmonary edema is severe). Mechanical support devices (intra-aortic balloon pump, ventricular assist device, ECMO) may be used in refractory cases.","Obstructive shock: remove the obstruction ASAP. For tension pneumothorax, do immediate needle decompression followed by chest tube. For cardiac tamponade, perform urgent pericardiocentesis. For massive PE, administer thrombolytics (or surgical thrombectomy if indicated). While addressing the cause, support circulation with IV fluids (to augment preload in RV outflow obstruction) and vasopressors if needed; provide oxygen/ventilation support for respiratory distress.","Distributive shock: treat underlying cause + vasopressor support. In septic shock, give broad-spectrum antibiotics early (after cultures), aggressive IV fluids (≈30 mL/kg initial bolus), and start a norepinephrine drip for persistent hypotension. Add vasopressin or epinephrine if needed, and consider corticosteroids if refractory. In anaphylactic shock, first-line is IM epinephrine (vasoconstricts and bronchodilates), plus IV fluids, oxygen, and adjuncts like antihistamines and IV steroids; secure the airway early if angioedema is present. In neurogenic shock, give IV fluids and vasopressors (e.g., phenylephrine or norepinephrine) to counteract vasodilation, and atropine IV for significant bradycardia. Also ensure prompt spinal immobilization and neurosurgical evaluation for trauma."],"red_flags":["Refractory shock: if a patient remains hypotensive despite aggressive fluids and high-dose vasopressors, it signals impending circulatory collapse (high mortality). This refractory shock state may require advanced therapies (e.g., ECMO for cardiogenic shock, additional vasopressors, or urgent surgical intervention) and expert critical care management.","End-organ dysfunction: watch for signs like altered mental status, cessation of urine output (anuria), or rising lactate >4 mmol/L. These indicate decompensated shock and onset of irreversible damage. Prolonged shock can lead to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) – e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute tubular necrosis (kidney failure), ischemic hepatitis (\"shock liver\"), or DIC – which are often irreversible. Immediate escalation of care is needed to try to prevent this progression."],"algorithm":["Suspect shock if hypotension + signs of hypoperfusion (confusion, oliguria, cool skin, high lactate) → immediately call for help and begin ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). Place the patient supine, give 100% oxygen, and establish IV access.","Initiate fluid resuscitation: start a rapid 500–1000 mL IV crystalloid bolus (unless cardiogenic shock is obvious) and repeat as needed while monitoring response. Draw blood for labs (CBC, electrolytes, lactate, coags, type & cross) and consider placing a Foley catheter to track urine output.","Identify the shock type: perform a focused exam during resuscitation. Check JVP (distended vs flat), listen for heart murmurs or muffled tones, examine lung sounds (rales vs absent on one side), check for abdominal pain or distension, look for hives or trauma. Use bedside ultrasound (e.g., EFAST exam for internal bleeding, cardiac echo for tamponade or ventricular function, lung ultrasound for pneumothorax or pulmonary edema, IVC collapsibility for volume status). This step should happen rapidly (within minutes) to guide therapy.","Treat while diagnosing: do not wait for complete workup to start specific treatment. If hemorrhage is suspected, initiate massive blood transfusion; if cardiac tamponade is evident, do pericardiocentesis; if sepsis is likely, administer broad antibiotics and pursue source control (e.g., abscess drainage) promptly; if anaphylaxis, give IM epinephrine immediately. For cardiogenic shock due to MI, activate the cath lab for emergency revascularization. Addressing the cause is as critical as supportive care.","Escalate care and monitor: frequently reassess vital signs, mental status, and perfusion. If shock persists, add vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine as first-line) and titrate to maintain MAP ≥65. Consider invasive monitoring (arterial line for BP, central line for CVP). Transfer to an ICU for advanced support. If the patient is not responding, involve specialty teams (surgery, cardiology, critical care). Be prepared for advanced support like mechanical ventilation (to reduce O₂ demand) or mechanical circulatory support (IABP, ECMO) in refractory cardiogenic shock.

In other words, one eye may point in a different direction than the other when focusing on an object. (Also called \"crossed eyes\" or \"squint\".)","why_it_matters":"Strabismus is relatively common (~2–4% of children). If not corrected early, the brain may suppress input from the deviating eye to avoid double vision, leading to **amblyopia** (permanent vision loss in that eye). Misalignment also impairs **depth perception** and can cause psychosocial issues due to the visible eye deviation. In adults, new-onset strabismus causes **diplopia** (double vision) and may signal serious neurologic pathology.","how_youll_see_it":["**Infants:** A constant, large-angle esotropia (one eye turned inward) noted by ~6 months of age suggests **congenital strabismus**. (Newborns can have transient misalignment up to 3–4 months, called ocular instability of infancy.)","**Toddlers/Children:** Often present with an eye that intermittently drifts inward or outward. For example, a farsighted toddler around age 2–4 may develop **accommodative esotropia**, where focusing to see clearly triggers one eye to cross inward. Children rarely complain of double vision because the brain suppresses one eye's image, but this can lead to amblyopia in the affected eye.","**Older Children/Teens:** May develop an **intermittent exotropia** (one eye drifting outward) that becomes noticeable when the child is tired, daydreaming, or in bright light. Such a child might squint or close one eye in sunlight to avoid diplopia. Vision is usually normal in each eye, but they may have difficulty with depth perception during episodes.","**Adults:** New-onset strabismus typically presents with **horizontal or vertical diplopia** (double vision). The misalignment is often due to an acquired cranial nerve palsy (e.g., CN VI palsy causing an eye that cannot abduct, leading to esotropia). Adults might notice an abnormal head posture (e.g., a head tilt in CN IV palsy) to compensate."],"problem_solving":["First, differentiate true strabismus from **pseudostrabismus**. Use the corneal light reflex (Hirschberg) test: shine a light and observe reflection on the corneas. In true strabismus, the light reflex will be asymmetrically placed; in pseudostrabismus (e.g. due to broad nasal bridge or epicanthal folds), the corneal reflections are symmetric despite a cross-eyed appearance.","Perform a **cover test** to detect a manifest deviation (tropia): cover one eye and watch the other eye – if it moves to take up fixation, a tropia is present. Then do the **cover-uncover test**: after covering an eye for a few seconds, uncover it and observe movement – a movement upon uncovering indicates a latent misalignment (**phoria**) that was previously controlled.","Always check the **red reflex** in each eye (Brückner test). An asymmetric or absent red reflex (leukocoria) in a strabismic eye is a red flag for an ocular media opacity or **retinoblastoma** in that eye. A bright or \"white\" pupillary reflex in one eye of a child with strabismus warrants urgent specialist evaluation.","Assess extraocular movements to identify any **incomitant strabismus** (where misalignment varies by gaze direction). Limited movement of one eye (e.g., inability to abduct = possible CN VI palsy) suggests a paralytic cause. If strabismus had acute onset, especially with neurologic symptoms (headache, ptosis, etc.), evaluate for a cranial nerve palsy or intracranial process and consider neuroimaging.","Measure each eye's **visual acuity** and perform a refraction. Significant uncorrected hyperopia can cause accommodative esotropia – correcting the refractive error with glasses often straightens the eyes. Also look for signs of **amblyopia** (poor vision in one eye) due to prolonged suppression, which will need to be addressed."],"differentials":[{"name":"Pseudostrabismus","hint":"False appearance of misalignment (often from wide nasal bridge or epicanthal folds); corneal light reflex is normal (symmetric)"},{"name":"Ocular instability of infancy","hint":"Transient intermittent misalignment in neonates (<3–4 months old) which resolves spontaneously"},{"name":"Cranial nerve palsy","hint":"Paralytic strabismus due to CN III, IV, or VI palsy (e.g., abducens nerve palsy causing an esotropic eye that cannot abduct).

In some cases, **Botox injections** into an extraocular muscle may temporarily improve alignment or assess potential surgical outcomes.","**Surgical alignment**: Strabismus surgery (recession or resection of extraocular muscles) is indicated for large or persistent deviations not fully corrected by other means.
