  "definition": "Acute vasculitis of childhood (usually <5 years) involving medium-sized arteries (especially coronary arteries), marked by ≥5 days of fever plus mucocutaneous inflammation (conjunctivitis, rash, oral changes, swollen extremities, cervical lymphadenopathy).",
  "why_it_matters": "It's the leading cause of acquired **heart disease** in children. Untreated KD has a ~15–25% risk of **coronary aneurysms** leading to thrombosis, **myocardial infarction**, or death. Early recognition and IVIG treatment dramatically lower these complications, making KD a critical diagnosis to know for timely intervention.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Typically affects young children (<5 years, peak ~1–2 years), with boys slightly more often than girls (≈1.5:1). Often occurs in winter or spring and is more common in children of Asian ancestry.",
    "Classic presentation: ≥5 days of high **fever** (often unresponsive to antipyretics) plus **bilateral non-exudative conjunctivitis**, a polymorphous **rash** (often starting in the groin area), **mucositis** (cracked red lips and a **strawberry tongue**), **hand and foot erythema** with swelling (later peeling skin), and **cervical lymphadenopathy** >1.5 cm (usually unilateral). The mnemonic **CRASH and burn** (Conjunctivitis, Rash, Adenopathy, Strawberry tongue, Hand/foot changes + fever) summarizes these findings.",
    "Incomplete KD: infants <12 months (or older kids) may have prolonged fever with only 2–3 of the above features. In such cases, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (**CRP, ESR**) and supportive lab findings (e.g. high platelets, low albumin, elevated ALT, sterile pyuria) or an abnormal echocardiogram (coronary artery dilation) can clinch the diagnosis."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Apply diagnostic criteria: **fever ≥5 days** plus ≥4 of the 5 principal features (conjunctivitis, rash, oral changes, extremity changes, lymphadenopathy) indicates complete KD. If <4 features, evaluate for **incomplete KD** – check CRP/ESR and supplemental labs; if inflammation is high or coronary changes are seen on **echocardiogram**, treat as KD.",
    "Rule out other causes of fever and rash (e.g. strep **scarlet fever**, viral infections), but **do not delay** IVIG treatment while awaiting test results if KD is strongly suspected.",
    "Obtain a baseline **echocardiography** at diagnosis to assess coronary arteries and cardiac function. Repeat echo at 1–2 weeks and 6–8 weeks after onset to monitor for coronary aneurysms.",
    "Start treatment **ASAP** (ideally by day 5–10 of illness): administer high-dose **IVIG** (2 g/kg IV infusion) together with high-dose **aspirin**. IVIG dramatically reduces coronary aneurysm risk.",
    "Expect defervescence (fever resolution) within ~36 hours of IVIG. If fever persists >36 hours post-IVIG (IVIG-resistant KD), give a second IVIG; consider adding **corticosteroids** or other anti-inflammatories (e.g. infliximab) if refractory.",
    "Arrange follow-up with cardiology for any coronary involvement. Large or giant aneurysms may require anticoagulation (e.g. **warfarin**) and long-term monitoring to prevent thrombosis."

    {
      "id": "scarlet-fever",
      "hint": "GAS **scarlet fever** – also causes fever, **strawberry tongue** and rash, but typically with exudative pharyngitis and a sandpaper rash; lacks conjunctivitis or extremity swelling."
    },
    {
      "id": "measles",
      "hint": "**Measles** – presents with fever, rash, and conjunctivitis, but also **cough** and Koplik spots; rash is morbilliform and child appears more toxic."

      "hint": "**Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children** – a post-COVID hyperinflammatory condition that can mimic KD but often in older children with **shock**, pronounced GI symptoms, and myocardial dysfunction."
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Remember **CRASH & burn**: Conjunctivitis, Rash, Adenopathy, Strawberry tongue, Hand/feet changes + fever (burn) as the diagnostic elements.",
    "One of the few pediatric illnesses where **aspirin** is indicated despite Reye syndrome concerns. (High-dose aspirin is used acutely for its anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects.)",
    "Conjunctivitis in KD is classically **bilateral, non-purulent, and limbic-sparing** (redness spares the iris limbus).",
    "After IVIG treatment, live virus **vaccines** (MMR, varicella) should be deferred for 11 months due to IVIG interference with vaccine efficacy."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Toddler (e.g. 3-year-old) with 6 days of high fever, irritability, **bilateral red eyes** (no discharge), cracked red lips and **strawberry tongue**, a polymorphic rash, swollen hands and feet, and a large unilateral neck node → **Kawasaki disease** (classic presentation; start IVIG and aspirin to prevent coronary aneurysms).",
    "Infant (e.g. 8-month-old) with ≥7 days of unexplained fever and irritability but only some KD features (maybe rash and conjunctival injection). Labs show high CRP and platelets, and an echocardiogram reveals a coronary artery aneurysm → **Incomplete Kawasaki disease** (recognize atypical presentation and treat promptly to avoid cardiac complications)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**IVIG** (2 g/kg IV once) – mainstay therapy to reduce coronary artery complications; give ideally within the first 10 days of illness.",
    "**Aspirin** – high-dose (80–100 mg/kg/day divided) during acute phase for anti-inflammatory effect, then low-dose (3–5 mg/kg) daily for 6–8 weeks (or longer if coronary aneurysms present) for antiplatelet protection.",
    "If persistent fever after initial IVIG, repeat IVIG dose. For refractory cases, add **corticosteroids** (e.g. IV methylprednisolone) or consider **infliximab**.",
    "All patients should undergo follow-up **echocardiograms** (at 1–2 weeks and ~6 weeks) to monitor coronary arteries. Those with coronary aneurysms require long-term cardiology care (possible lifelong if large aneurysms), including management of thrombosis risk (anticoagulation) and monitoring for ischemia."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Infants <6 months old with **≥7 days of fever** but few other findings – high risk for incomplete KD and often develop coronary aneurysms if untreated. Do not dismiss prolonged fever in young infants; consider KD evaluation.",
    "Any KD patient with signs of **cardiac ischemia** (chest pain, pallor, shock, arrhythmia) → suspect **coronary thrombosis** or myocardial infarction from an aneurysm. This is an emergency – requires immediate intervention (e.g. angioplasty, thrombolysis).",
    "Delay in treatment beyond 10 days significantly increases risk of irreversible coronary damage – do **not** wait for peeling or all criteria if KD is likely; treat early."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Child with **fever ≥5 days** → evaluate for Kawasaki (especially age <5, no obvious infection).",
    "If classic **CRASH** features (≥4 of 5) are present → diagnose **Kawasaki disease** and begin IVIG/aspirin promptly.",
    "If only 2–3 features: check **CRP/ESR**. If elevated, look for supplemental labs (high platelets, low albumin, etc) or get an **echo**. Lab evidence of inflammation or any coronary artery changes → treat as **incomplete KD**.",
    "Do **not** delay treatment: initiate IVIG (don't wait for day 10) as soon as KD is diagnosed (or strongly suspected).",
    "Ensure follow-up **echocardiography** at 2 and 6–8 weeks post-onset to detect late-developing aneurysms. Long-term management if coronary sequelae are present (cardiology follow-up, possible anticoagulation)."
