  "definition": "Cardiac **preexcitation** syndrome caused by an accessory atrioventricular pathway (Bundle of Kent) that bypasses the AV node; characterized by a short PR interval and a slurred \"delta\" wave on ECG.",
  "why_it_matters": "Common cause of **paroxysmal SVT** in young patients and can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias (pre-excited **atrial fibrillation** can degenerate into **ventricular fibrillation**). Recognizing WPW is critical because certain medications (AV nodal blockers) can precipitate ventricular fibrillation.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Typically a **young** patient with sudden episodes of **palpitations** or tachycardia that start and stop abruptly (AV reentrant tachycardia). Most have structurally normal hearts.",
    "Baseline **ECG** in sinus rhythm shows **short PR interval** (<120 ms) and a **delta wave** (slurred upstroke at the start of a slightly widened QRS complex).",
    "Episodes can be triggered by exercise, stress, caffeine, or alcohol. Rarely, WPW presents as **atrial fibrillation** with an **irregular, wide QRS** tachycardia at very high rates (pre-excited AF)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Remember the WPW triad: **short PR, delta wave, and widened QRS** (fusion of normal and preexcited ventricular activation).",
    "Distinguish **orthodromic AVRT** (regular **narrow**-complex SVT utilizing the AV node antegradely) from **antidromic AVRT** (regular **wide**-complex SVT with antegrade conduction via the accessory pathway). Treat narrow SVT like typical AVNRT (vagal maneuvers, adenosine), but wide-complex SVT should be treated with caution (consider it could be VT or antidromic AVRT).",
    "**Pre-excited atrial fibrillation** (irregularly irregular wide-complex tachycardia in WPW) is a medical emergency – avoid AV node blockers and use **procainamide** or immediate cardioversion."

      "name": "Ventricular tachycardia",
      "hint": "wide-complex tachycardia; in older patients or those with structural heart disease"

  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: **W-P-W** → **W**ide QRS, **P**R interval short, **W**ave (delta wave).",

    "Young adult with episodic palpitations and a **delta wave** on ECG → Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (accessory pathway causing AVRT).",
    "Patient with WPW develops **atrial fibrillation** with very fast, **irregular wide QRS** complexes → pre-excited AF (risk of **ventricular fibrillation**)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Acute SVT (orthodromic AVRT)**: start with **vagal maneuvers** (Valsalva, carotid massage); if unsuccessful, give IV **adenosine** to terminate the reentrant circuit. If unstable, perform synchronized cardioversion.",
    "**Pre-excited AF or wide complex tachycardia**: **procainamide IV** is the drug of choice to restore normal rhythm (or use IV ibutilide); **avoid AV nodal blockers** (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, adenosine) as they can precipitate ventricular fibrillation. Urgent cardioversion if hemodynamically unstable.",
    "**Long-term**: Definitive treatment is **radiofrequency catheter ablation** of the accessory pathway (curative in >95% of cases). Antiarrhythmic medications (e.g. class IC or III) are second-line if not ablating."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Atrial fibrillation in WPW** (pre-excited AF): presents as an extremely rapid, irregular tachycardia and can deteriorate into **ventricular fibrillation** (sudden cardiac death). **Never give AV node–blocking drugs** in this scenario.",
    "WPW patients with **syncope** or episodes of **atrial fibrillation** (especially if the accessory pathway has a short refractory period) are at higher risk for SCD and should be referred for urgent evaluation (possible ablation)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Patient with palpitations → obtain **ECG** (look for WPW pattern: short PR, delta wave).",
    "If **WPW pattern** is present: assess symptoms and risk. Asymptomatic patients without high-risk features can be observed with follow-up; symptomatic or high-risk patients should be referred to **electrophysiology** for risk stratification and possible ablation.",
    "Acute tachyarrhythmia in WPW: if unstable → immediate **cardioversion**; if stable, determine rhythm: **regular narrow SVT** (treat with vagal maneuvers, adenosine) vs **wide/irregular SVT** (treat as WPW with AF – use procainamide, no AV nodal blockers)."
