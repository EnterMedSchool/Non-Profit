    "definition": "Genetic cardiomyopathy (usually autosomal dominant) characterized by unexplained left‑ventricular hypertrophy (often asymmetric septal) that can cause dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO), diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, and atrial/ventricular arrhythmias. Adult diagnosis is typically by imaging with maximal LV wall thickness ≥15 mm (or 13–14 mm in the presence of a pathogenic sarcomeric variant or clear family history) in the absence of another cause of hypertrophy.",
"why_it_matters": "Common inherited heart disease (~0.2% ≈ 1 in 500 adults) and a leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young, including athletes. Accurate recognition changes exercise counseling, family screening, SCD prevention (ICD decisions), and symptom management (beta‑blockers, myosin inhibitors, or septal reduction at expert centers).",
"how_youll_see_it": [
        "Symptoms: exertional dyspnea, chest pain, presyncope/syncope (classically during or just after exertion), palpitations; many are asymptomatic.",
        "Exam (obstructive physiology): harsh systolic crescendo–decrescendo murmur at left lower sternal border that **increases** with Valsalva/standing and **decreases** with squatting/handgrip; S4; possibly brisk/bisferiens carotid pulse.",
        "ECG: LVH with repolarization changes; deep, narrow “dagger‑like” Q waves in lateral (I, aVL, V5–V6) ± inferior (II, III, aVF) leads; sometimes normal.",
        "Echo: asymmetric septal hypertrophy; systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve; dynamic LVOTO (at rest or with provocation); secondary MR; small LV cavity; diastolic dysfunction.",
        "CMR: clarifies patterns (e.g., apical HCM), detects apical aneurysm, and quantifies fibrosis (late gadolinium enhancement).",
        "Genetics: pathogenic variants most often in **MYH7** and **MYBPC3**; also TNNT2, TNNI3, TPM1, MYL2/MYL3, ACTC1. Variable penetrance and expression."
    ],
"problem_solving": [
        "Confirm **unexplained** LVH: rule out severe hypertension, aortic stenosis, athlete’s heart, infiltrative/storage disease (amyloid, Fabry/GLA, Danon/LAMP2, PRKAG2) before labeling HCM.",
        "Quantify obstruction: measure LVOT gradient at rest and with provocation (Valsalva, exercise, post‑PVC, amyl nitrite). A **peak gradient ≥30 mm Hg** indicates obstruction; **≥50 mm Hg** is a typical threshold for advanced therapy in symptomatic patients.",
        "Risk‑stratify SCD (initial and q1–2 y): prior cardiac arrest/VT, family history of premature SCD, unexplained (likely arrhythmic) syncope, maximal wall thickness (e.g., ≥30 mm), apical aneurysm, LVEF < 50%, non‑sustained VT on ambulatory ECG, and extensive LGE on CMR. Use guideline calculators and shared decision‑making for ICD.",
        "Differentiate HCM from athlete’s heart: athlete’s has symmetric LVH, larger LV cavity, normal/augmented diastolic function, and regression with detraining; HCM often has asymmetric hypertrophy, small cavity, diastolic dysfunction, and fibrosis on CMR.",
        "AF in HCM: low threshold for anticoagulation (DOACs first‑line) even with paroxysms ≥24 h; rhythm control often preferred; consider ablation in experienced centers.",
        "Family cascade: offer diagnostic genetic testing to proband; screen first‑degree relatives by ECG + echo (intervals by age/risk) and/or targeted genetic testing if a pathogenic variant is found."
    ],
    "tricks": [
        "Dynamic murmur logic: ↓preload/↓afterload (Valsalva, standing) → **louder** HCM murmur; ↑preload/↑afterload (squatting, handgrip) → **softer**. Opposite pattern of most left‑sided systolic murmurs.",
        "Avoid preload/afterload reducers (nitrates, ACEi/ARB, dihydropyridine CCBs) and high‑dose diuretics in **obstructive** HCM—they can worsen gradients.",
        "Pulsus bisferiens (double‑peaked carotid) can occur in obstructive HCM (and severe AR).",
        "If symptomatic obstruction despite beta‑blocker or non‑DHP CCB, adding **disopyramide** (negative inotrope) can reduce gradients while awaiting definitive therapy.",
        "Brockenbrough–Braunwald–Morrow sign: after a PVC, LV systolic pressure rises but aortic pulse pressure falls—hemodynamic clue to dynamic subaortic obstruction."

    "treatment": [
        "Lifestyle & counseling: stay hydrated; avoid sudden preload/afterload drops; individualized sports counsel—**mild‑to‑moderate recreational exercise is encouraged**; expert‑led evaluation for higher‑intensity competition.",
        "Obstructive HCM (symptomatic): **non‑vasodilating beta‑blockers** first‑line; if not tolerated/ineffective → **verapamil or diltiazem** (avoid in hypotension/high gradients); add **disopyramide** if needed.",
