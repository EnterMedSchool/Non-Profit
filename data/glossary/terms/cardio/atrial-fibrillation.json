  "why_it_matters": "Most common sustained arrhythmia; associated with ≈5× higher **stroke** risk (atrial clots can embolize) and increased mortality. Can also cause **heart failure** (tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy) if uncontrolled. Frequent exam topic linking arrhythmia to stroke prevention.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Symptoms range from **palpitations**, anxiety, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness to **syncope** – or even **asymptomatic** (incidental). Pulse is classically **irregularly irregular**; apex heart rate may exceed peripheral pulse rate (pulse deficit).",
    "Often in older patients with **hypertension** or structural heart disease (**coronary artery disease**, **heart failure**, valvular disease like rheumatic mitral stenosis). Other triggers: acute illness or infection, **thyrotoxicosis** (new AF + weight loss/tremor → check TSH), **alcohol binge** ('holiday heart'), surgery, pulmonary embolism."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Confirm diagnosis with **ECG** (absent P waves, irregularly spaced QRS complexes). Evaluate for precipitating causes: check **TSH** (hyperthyroidism), electrolytes, etc.",
    "Assess stability: if **hemodynamic instability** (hypotension, acute heart failure, angina) → immediate **synchronized cardioversion**.",
    "If stable: initiate **rate control** (e.g., IV beta blocker or diltiazem for rapid AF; **digoxin** if hypotensive or in systolic HF). Consider **rhythm control** (antiarrhythmics or elective cardioversion) for persistent symptoms, difficulty controlling rate, or in younger patients.",
    "Estimate stroke risk with **CHA₂DS₂-VASc** score and decide on anticoagulation. Generally, ≥2 (men) or ≥3 (women) → chronic anticoagulation indicated (barring contraindications).",
    "Perform a **transthoracic echocardiogram** to identify structural heart disease (e.g., valve stenosis, left atrial enlargement) and help guide management. If AF duration >48 h before planned cardioversion, patient needs 3 weeks of anticoagulation or a transesophageal echo to exclude atrial clot."

      "name": "Multifocal atrial tachycardia",
      "hint": "irregular atrial rhythm but with **≥3 distinct P-wave morphologies** on ECG (classically in COPD)"

  "tricks": [
    "Clue: **Hyperthyroidism** often presents as new-onset AF – always check a **TSH** level.",
    "Mnemonic: **CHA₂DS₂-VASc** for stroke risk factors in AF: **C**HF, **H**ypertension, **A**ge ≥75 (2 points), **D**iabetes, **S**troke/TIA (2), **V**ascular disease, **A**ge 65–74, **S**ex Category (female).",

  "exam_appearance": [
    "Elderly patient with long-standing hypertension and diabetes, now with palpitations, an irregularly irregular heartbeat, and absent P waves on ECG → **Atrial fibrillation** (rate control and anticoagulate as indicated).",
    "Middle-aged patient with **weight loss**, tremor, and tachycardia is found to have AF → AF secondary to **thyrotoxicosis** (check TSH; treat the hyperthyroidism and use beta blockers).",
    "Otherwise healthy adult with an episode of AF after heavy **alcohol** intake (holiday celebration) → 'Holiday heart' syndrome (paroxysmal AF triggered by alcohol binge)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Rate control: **β-blockers** (e.g., metoprolol) or non-dihydropyridine **calcium channel blockers** (diltiazem) to slow AV conduction (goal <110 bpm at rest). Add **digoxin** in refractory cases or if concomitant HFrEF.",
    "Rhythm control: consider **cardioversion** (electrical or pharmacologic) for new-onset or symptomatic AF. Antiarrhythmics (e.g., flecainide, sotalol, amiodarone) or catheter ablation can be used to maintain sinus rhythm in recurrent AF, especially in younger patients.",
    "Anticoagulation: indicated for stroke prevention in eligible patients (per CHA₂DS₂-VASc). **DOACs** (direct oral anticoagulants like apixaban) are first-line for non-valvular AF. Use **warfarin** in valvular AF (e.g., mechanical valve or rheumatic MS)."

    "AF with **hemodynamic instability** (hypotension, pulmonary edema, chest pain) → emergency synchronized **cardioversion** is required.",
    "AF with **WPW (Wolff-Parkinson-White)**: irregular wide-complex tachycardia → avoid AV nodal blockers (risk of VF); use **procainamide** or immediate cardioversion."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Irregularly irregular pulse → get **ECG** to confirm AF (no P waves).",
    "Unstable patient (hypotension, etc) → **immediate cardioversion**.",
    "Stable → control **rate** (AV nodal blocker); consider rhythm control if needed (e.g., cardioversion).",
    "Assess **CHA₂DS₂-VASc** stroke risk → if elevated, start anticoagulation (prefer DOACs).",
    "Investigate underlying causes: check **TSH**, echo for structural heart disease; manage reversible triggers (e.g., stop alcohol)."
