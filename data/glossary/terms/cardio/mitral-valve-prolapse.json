  "definition": "Bulging (prolapse) of one or both mitral valve leaflets into the left atrium during systole, due to degeneration of valve tissue (myxomatous change). Often causes a characteristic **mid-systolic click** with or without a late systolic murmur, and can lead to **mitral regurgitation**.",
  "why_it_matters": "Common valvular disorder (~2% of people) and the leading cause of non-ischemic **mitral regurgitation**. Usually benign, but can sometimes result in severe MR with **heart failure**, arrhythmias (rarely sudden death), **infective endocarditis**, or stroke. A classic exam topic due to its distinctive auscultation findings (click-murmur) and associations (e.g. **Marfan** syndrome).",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Often **asymptomatic**: many cases are found incidentally during a routine exam (hearing a click/murmur) or via echocardiogram.",
    "Common scenario: a young **female** patient with **palpitations**, **atypical chest pain** (non-exertional), or **anxiety**; on exam she has a **mid-systolic click** followed by a late systolic murmur at the apex.",
    "Associated with connective tissue diseases: patients with **Marfan** or **Ehlers-Danlos** (tall, thin habitus, hyperflexible joints, maybe pectus excavatum) often have MVP due to myxomatous valve changes.",
    "If **severe mitral regurgitation** develops, patients can present with **dyspnea**, fatigue, or arrhythmias later in life. Exam then shows a **holosystolic murmur** (from MR) that can obscure the click."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspected MVP (hearing a click/murmur) is confirmed by **echocardiography**, which shows leaflet displacement (>2 mm beyond annulus) and can quantify mitral regurgitation.",
    "Know the maneuvers: **standing/Valsalva** (↓ venous return) make the click occur earlier and murmur longer, whereas **squatting/handgrip** (↑ afterload/volume) delay the click and shorten the murmur. This helps distinguish MVP’s murmur from others (e.g. differentiating it from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).",
    "If the patient has **palpitations or syncope**, evaluate for arrhythmias. MVP can cause ventricular ectopic beats or arrhythmias in some patients (Holter monitoring or ECG may show PVCs, etc.).",
    "**No antibiotic prophylaxis** is needed for MVP (for dental or minor procedures) unless the patient has a history of infective endocarditis or valve repair.",
    "Don’t confuse MVP’s mid-systolic click with an **aortic ejection click** (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve): the latter occurs earlier (right after S1), at the base of the heart, and does **not change with position**."
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "The hallmark **mid-systolic click** is practically diagnostic of MVP.",
    "MVP murmur **moves with maneuvers**: it gets longer/louder when standing, and shorter/softer when squatting (due to LV volume changes).",
    "Common in young women — historically called **Barlow syndrome**; these patients often have palpitations or anxiety but a benign prognosis.",
    "Associations: think **connective tissue** – conditions like Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos often feature MVP (myxomatous valves).",
    "**Most common cause of MR** in patients without coronary heart disease (MVP causes degenerative mitral regurgitation).",
    "Exam update: **no prophylactic antibiotics** needed for MVP (unless there’s a prosthetic valve or prior endocarditis)."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "name": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM)",
      "hint": "Harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur at left sternal border; **no click**; murmur also changes with maneuvers but is heard in a different location (septal hypertrophy on echo)."
    },
    {
      "name": "Chronic mitral regurgitation",
      "hint": "Holosystolic **blowing** murmur at apex (radiating to axilla), beginning immediately at S1 (no mid-systolic click). Often due to ischemic or rheumatic disease."
    },
    {
      "name": "Bicuspid aortic valve",
      "hint": "Early systolic ejection click at the right upper sternal border with a systolic murmur; aortic click occurs right after S1 and **does not vary** with squatting/standing."
    }
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Young woman with anxiety, palpitations, and **atypical chest pain**; exam reveals a mid-systolic click and late systolic murmur that becomes softer when squatting → **Mitral valve prolapse**.",
    "Tall, thin patient with long limbs and **hyperflexible joints** (Marfanoid habitus), plus a mid-systolic click on auscultation → **Mitral valve prolapse** (associated with connective tissue disorder).",
    "Older patient with history of MVP who now has exertional dyspnea and a new **holosystolic murmur** radiating to the axilla → **Severe mitral regurgitation** due to progressed MVP."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "If asymptomatic and trivial regurgitation: **reassurance** and observation (no treatment needed).",
    "For autonomic symptoms (palpitations, chest pain, anxiety): **beta blockers** (e.g. propranolol) can help alleviate symptoms.",
    "When **severe MR** is present (especially with symptoms or LV dysfunction): recommend **mitral valve repair** (surgery) before heart failure ensues.",
    "Manage arrhythmias if they occur (e.g., treat atrial fibrillation with rate control and anticoagulation as appropriate).",
    "No need for antibiotic prophylaxis for MVP (unless there’s a prosthetic valve or prior endocarditis)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Acute chordae rupture**: sudden chest pain, pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock in an MVP patient could indicate a ruptured chordae tendineae causing acute severe MR (flail leaflet) – a surgical emergency.",
    "**Unexplained syncope** or complex ventricular arrhythmias (PVCs, VT) in MVP – could signify malignant arrhythmic MVP with risk of sudden death; requires urgent cardiology evaluation.",
    "**Heart failure** signs (new dyspnea, edema) or **LV dilation** on echo in an MVP patient – suggests progression to severe chronic MR; consider timely valve repair to prevent permanent damage."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Auscultation suggests MVP (click ± murmur) → obtain a transthoracic **echocardiogram** to confirm prolapse and assess degree of MR.",
    "If MVP is confirmed with **no significant MR and no symptoms** → periodic follow-up (e.g., exam and echo every few years).",
    "If **symptomatic** (palpitations, chest pain) but **no severe MR** → conservative management (reassurance, lifestyle, ± beta blockers) and evaluate/treat other causes of symptoms.",
    "If **severe MR or LV dysfunction** on echo (even if asymptomatic) → refer for **mitral valve repair** (surgical intervention) before onset of heart failure symptoms.",
    "In all cases, address complications: e.g., manage atrial fibrillation (anticoagulate if needed), and remember no endocarditis prophylaxis is required for uncomplicated MVP."
