  "definition": "**Messenger RNA** is a <u>single-stranded RNA copy of a gene</u> that serves as a <u>template for protein synthesis</u>. **mRNA** is transcribed from DNA in the nucleus and carries the genetic message to the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate that message into a protein.",
  "tips": [
    "An **mRNA** molecule is essentially a \"messenger\" between DNA and protein: it has a sequence of **codons** (three-base sequences) that <u>specify amino acids</u>.",
    "In eukaryotes, a mature mRNA has a <u>5' cap and a 3' poly-A tail</u>, which protect it and help it interact with ribosomes. These features distinguish **mRNA** from other RNA types.",
    "**mRNA is transient.** Cells constantly produce, use, and degrade mRNAs. This allows <u>regulation of protein production</u> - short-lived mRNAs mean protein isn't made for long."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "If a question asks which molecule <u>carries genetic code from the nucleus to ribosomes</u>, the answer is **mRNA**. A classic clue is \"RNA that codes for protein\".",
    "Questions about **codons** usually point to **mRNA**. For example, \"which RNA contains codons for amino acids-\" -> **mRNA** (because tRNA has anticodons, not codons).",
    "Be careful not to confuse mRNA with other RNAs on exams. If the context is <u>carrying information or the result of transcription</u>, it's **mRNA** (not tRNA or rRNA)."
