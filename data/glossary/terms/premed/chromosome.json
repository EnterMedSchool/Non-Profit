  "definition": "A **chromosome** is a <u>threadlike structure made of protein and a single DNA molecule</u> that carries genomic information. In plants and animals, chromosomes are located in the cell nucleus.",
  "tips": [
    "Humans have **22 pairs of autosomes plus 1 pair of sex chromosomes (XX or XY)** = <u>46 total chromosomes</u>.",
    "Each **chromosome pair** includes <u>one chromosome inherited from each parent</u>.",
    "Chromosomes aren't **visible in the nucleus when a cell is not dividing**; they become <u>more tightly packed during cell division</u> and can then be seen under a microscope."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "If a stem says DNA in the nucleus is packaged into thread-like structures made of DNA coiled around histone proteins -> that's describing **<u>chromosomes</u>**.",
    "If a question asks for the typical chromosome count in a human cell -> **<u>23 pairs (46 total)</u>**, with 22 autosome pairs and 1 sex-chromosome pair.",
    "If a prompt contrasts \"not visible when not dividing\" vs \"visible during division\" -> it's pointing to **<u>chromosome condensation during cell division</u>**."
