  "definition": "**Speciation** is the evolutionary process by which <u>one ancestral species splits into two or more new species</u>. It occurs when a population diverges enough (often via **reproductive isolation**) that its members can <u>no longer interbreed with the original group</u>.",
  "tips": [
    "**Reproductive isolation is key**: something (geography, behavior, genetics) stops <u>gene flow between groups</u>, allowing them to evolve separately into distinct species.",
    "Speciation can be **allopatric** (different locations, e.g., separated by a physical barrier) or **sympatric** (in the same location, via other mechanisms like genetic changes or niche differences).",
    "Hybrid offspring between related species (if they occur at all) are often <u>inviable or sterile</u> - this is evidence that speciation has occurred (e.g., a mule from a horse and donkey is sterile)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "If a question describes populations separated by a barrier (mountain, river, island) evolving differences such that they can't interbreed, that is **allopatric speciation** in action.",
    "Be prepared to identify mechanisms of **reproductive isolation** - e.g., a question might ask how things like different mating seasons or distinct mating calls can lead to speciation (they prevent interbreeding).",
    "A classic example often cited is **Darwin's finches** on the Gal\u00e1pagos: one ancestral species gave rise to many species on different islands (speciation by geographic isolation and adaptive radiation)."
