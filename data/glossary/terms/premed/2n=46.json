  "definition": "**\"2n = 46\"** is the notation indicating that an organism's <u>diploid number is 46</u>. In humans, this means each somatic cell has 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). Here, n (the haploid number) is 23, and <u>2n (two sets) is 46 total chromosomes</u>.",
  "tips": [
    "For humans: <u>2n = 46</u> (diploid) and <u>n = 23</u> (haploid). This is a fundamental fact - a human egg or sperm has 23 chromosomes, and when they combine, the zygote has 46.",
    "The notation 2n is general: if 2n = X, then <u>n = X/2</u>. For example, if a species has 2n = 16, its gametes have n = 8.",
    "Sometimes exam questions use this notation to test understanding of ploidy. Remember that \"=46\" refers to the <u>total number of chromosomes</u> in a diploid cell, not the number of chromosome pairs (though 46 corresponds to 23 pairs in humans)."

  "exam_appearance": [
    "Any question that says \"In species X, 2n = ...\" is giving you the diploid chromosome count. You might be asked to infer the haploid count, or to compare it to another species.",
    "A classic human biology question: \"How many chromosomes are in a human gamete if 2n = 46?\" The answer is **23** (because gametes are haploid, <u>n = 23</u>). Make sure you're comfortable converting between 2n and n."
