  "definition": "**Centrioles** are <u>paired barrel-shaped organelles</u> in the cytoplasm of animal cells near the nuclear envelope. They play a role in organizing microtubules and are normally found within the centrosome.",
  "tips": [
    "A centrosome contains **two centrioles** that lie at <u>right angles to each other</u>.",
    "Each centriole is a cylindrical structure made of **<u>nine triplets of microtubules</u>**.",
    "Centrioles are cylindrical structures similar to the **basal bodies of cilia and flagella**, and are probably <u>precursors of basal bodies</u>."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "If a stem describes a cylinder with \"nine triplets of microtubules\" -> **<u>centriole</u>**.",
    "If the question says \"paired barrel-shaped structures inside the centrosome\" -> **<u>centrioles</u>**.",
    "If a prompt links centrioles to basal bodies/cilia/flagella -> it's pointing at the **<u>structural similarity and centriole-to-basal-body connection</u>**."
