  "definition": "A **centrosome** is a <u>cellular structure involved in cell division</u>. Before division, the centrosome duplicates; as division begins, the two centrosomes move to opposite ends of the cell, and microtubules assemble into a spindle that helps separate replicated chromosomes into the daughter cells.",
  "tips": [
    "In animal cells, the centrosome is the **major microtubule-organizing center** located adjacent to the nucleus; during mitosis, microtubules extend from duplicated centrosomes to form the <u>mitotic spindle</u> that separates chromosomes.",
    "The centrosome is **duplicated during S phase**; the two centrosomes <u>give rise to the mitotic spindle</u>.",
    "In animal cells, the centrosome contains a **pair of centrioles** that <u>lie perpendicular to each other</u>."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "If a prompt says a structure duplicates, moves to opposite poles, and a spindle forms between them -> **<u>centrosomes</u>**.",
    "If the question asks for the main microtubule-organizing center in animal cells -> **<u>the centrosome</u>**.",
    "If you see \"pair of centrioles\" mentioned as part of an organelle near the nucleus -> that organelle is the **<u>centrosome</u>**."
