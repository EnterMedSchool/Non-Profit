  "definition": "**Haploid** describes a cell or organism that has only <u>one set of chromosomes</u>. In humans, the haploid number (n) is 23. Only <u>gametes (sperm and egg cells)</u> are haploid in humans - each carries 23 unpaired chromosomes, which is half the full (diploid) set.",
  "tips": [
    "We use **n** to denote the haploid number of chromosomes. In humans, <u>n = 23</u>. Thus, when fertilization occurs (sperm 23 + egg 23), the resulting zygote is <u>2n = 46</u>.",
    "Haploid cells are produced from diploid cells by <u>meiosis</u>. This reduction ensures that when two gametes fuse, the species' chromosome number stays constant across generations.",
    "Be aware: not all species have the same haploid number. (e.g., a fruit fly's haploid number is 4, so 2n=8). The concept of haploid just means \"one complete set,\" whatever that number is for the organism."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Typical question: \"Which cells in humans are haploid?\" Answer: **gametes (sperm and egg)**. Recognize that haploid cells have <u>half the chromosome count</u> of somatic cells.",
    "Another angle: A question might give an organism's diploid number and ask for the haploid number (or vice versa). For example, \"If 2n = 16, what is n?\" You should answer **8** (haploid number is 8)."
