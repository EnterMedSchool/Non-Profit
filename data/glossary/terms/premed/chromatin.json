  "definition": "**Chromatin** is a <u>mixture of DNA and proteins</u> that forms the chromosomes in humans and other higher organisms. Histone proteins help package DNA into a compact form that can fit inside the nucleus.",
  "tips": [
    "Chromatin = **DNA + proteins**; histones are key proteins that <u>package DNA to fit in the nucleus</u>.",
    "At the basic level, DNA wraps around histone proteins to form **nucleosomes**; nucleosomes are connected by linker DNA (often described as <u>\"beads on a string\"</u>).",
    "In interphase, <u>tightly packaged chromatin</u> is **heterochromatin** (genes usually not expressed), while <u>less dense chromatin</u> is **euchromatin** (genes usually transcribed)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "If you see \"DNA wrapped around histones\" or \"beads on a string\" -> **<u>nucleosomes/chromatin</u>**.",
    "If a question talks about chromatin being tightly packaged vs less dense in interphase -> **<u>heterochromatin vs euchromatin</u>**.",
    "If the stem is really about how DNA is packed to fit in the nucleus -> **<u>chromatin (the DNA-protein material)</u>** is the key idea."
