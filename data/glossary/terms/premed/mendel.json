  "definition": "**Gregor Mendel** (1822-1884) was an Austrian monk and scientist whose experiments with pea plants established the <u>basic laws of inheritance</u>. By cross-breeding pea plants and analyzing the traits in offspring, Mendel discovered that traits are inherited as <u>discrete units (genes)</u> with dominant and recessive forms. He is often called the <u>\"father of genetics\"</u> for formulating the **Law of Segregation** and the **Law of Independent Assortment**.",
  "tips": [
    "Mendel's work demonstrated that inheritance is <u>particulate</u> (not a blending of traits). For example, a white-flower trait could disappear in one generation and reappear in the next, which Mendel explained with <u>dominant and recessive alleles</u>.",
    "He performed thousands of crosses and kept careful counts of offspring phenotypes, which allowed him to see consistent **3:1** and **9:3:3:1** ratios - evidence for his genetic laws.",
    "Mendel's discoveries weren't appreciated in his lifetime; they were <u>\"rediscovered\" around 1900</u>, providing the foundation for modern genetics."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Mendel is frequently referenced in genetics questions. An exam might ask who first explained inheritance patterns (answer: **Gregor Mendel**) or invoke **\"Mendelian ratios\"** (like **3:1** or **9:3:3:1**) in genetic problems.",
    "His name is also used as an adjective - e.g., <u>\"Mendelian inheritance\"</u> refers to traits that follow the simple <u>dominant/recessive</u> patterns he observed. Be ready to identify scenarios that exemplify Mendelian inheritance."
