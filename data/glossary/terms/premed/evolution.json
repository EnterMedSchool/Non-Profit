  "definition": "**Evolution** is the <u>change in the heritable characteristics of a population over successive generations</u>. In other words, it describes how populations of organisms undergo <u>genetic change over time</u>.",
  "tips": [
    "Individuals do not evolve; **populations evolve** as <u>gene frequencies change from one generation to the next</u>.",
    "**Evolution isn't goal-oriented** -- natural selection favors <u>traits that improve survival or reproduction</u> in a given environment, but it doesn't \"plan\" for future needs.",
    "Mechanisms of evolution include **natural selection** (adaptive changes), **genetic drift** (random changes in small populations), **mutations** (introducing new genetic variation), and **gene flow** (migration)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "A question may ask who or what evolves - the correct answer is **populations (not individual organisms)**.",
    "If a question describes a shift in traits in a population (e.g., bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics over many generations), it's illustrating <u>evolution by natural selection</u>.",
    "Watch for trick wording like \"organism X evolved a trait because it needed it\" - in reality, <u>random mutations produced the trait and natural selection made it prevalent</u>; need does not cause mutations."
