  "definition": "The **centromere** is a <u>constricted region of a chromosome where spindle fibers attach during cell division</u>. After spindle attachment, sister chromatids are pulled to opposite sides of the dividing cell so the daughter cells end up with identical DNA.",
  "tips": [
    "Centromere = the **chromosome's constricted region** where <u>sister chromatids are held together</u>.",
    "Spindle fiber microtubules <u>attach to **kinetochore proteins** at the centromeres</u>; kinetochore proteins bind the centromere to spindle microtubules.",
    "The centromere <u>divides a chromosome into a **short p arm** and a **long q arm**</u> (used in gene/chromosome location notation)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "If you picture an X-shaped chromosome, the thin \"pinched\" region where the arms join -> the **<u>centromere</u>**.",
    "If the question mentions kinetochores attaching spindle microtubules to chromosomes -> the attachment site is at the **<u>centromere region</u>**.",
    "If a stem uses labels like Xp or 5q -> **<u>p and q arms are defined by the centromere position</u>**."
