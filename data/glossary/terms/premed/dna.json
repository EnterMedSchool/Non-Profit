  "definition": "**DNA** is the <u>hereditary material in nearly all living organisms</u>. It is a **double-stranded helix** of nucleotides (with the bases A, T, C, and G) that stores <u>genetic instructions</u> for the development and functioning of an organism.",
  "tips": [
    "DNA is mostly located in the **cell nucleus** (nuclear DNA), with a small amount in mitochondria (mtDNA). Each human cell's nucleus contains **<u>46 DNA molecules (chromosomes)</u>**.",
    "The two strands of DNA are **complementary**: <u>A always pairs with T, and C pairs with G</u>. This allows DNA to be copied (<u>semi-conservative replication</u>) reliably when cells divide.",
    "Nearly all living organisms use DNA as genetic material, but a few viruses have RNA genomes instead. <u>DNA's sugar is deoxyribose (no oxygen on the 2' carbon)</u>, distinguishing it from RNA's ribose."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "If a question mentions a \"**double helix**\" or nucleotides with **<u>thymine (T)</u>** bases, it's referring to **DNA** (as opposed to RNA, which is single-stranded and has uracil).",
    "Questions about the <u>storage of genetic information</u> (in chromosomes, genes, etc.) are targeting **DNA**. For example, \"genetic blueprint in the nucleus\" = **DNA**.",
    "Be prepared for comparisons between DNA and RNA: e.g., identifying that **DNA stays in the nucleus** (except mitochondrial DNA) while <u>RNA can travel to the cytoplasm</u>."
