  "definition": "**A bacterial ribosome** is the ribosome found in prokaryotic cells, responsible for protein synthesis in bacteria. It is a **70S ribosome, composed of a small 30S subunit and a large 50S subunit**. Bacterial ribosomes are smaller and structurally distinct from eukaryotic 80S ribosomes, which is why certain antibiotics can <u>selectively target bacterial protein synthesis without affecting human cells</u>.",
  "tips": [
    "**Subunits:** 70S prokaryotic ribosome = <u>50S (large) + 30S (small) subunits</u>. (Remember: S values aren-t additive, but these are the classic sizes for bacterial ribosomal subunits).",
    "**Location:** In bacteria (which lack a nucleus), ribosomes <u>float free in the cytoplasm</u>. Thousands of ribosomes may be active in a bacterial cell, often forming **polysomes** (multiple ribosomes translating one mRNA).",
    "**Antibiotic targets:** Many antibiotics (e.g., streptomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin) <u>bind to 30S or 50S subunits to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis</u>. Because eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosomes are 80S, these drugs target bacteria more than human cells."

    "Comparative structure - A question might ask: -What ribosomal difference exists between prokaryotes and eukaryotes that allows antibiotics to target bacteria-- The answer: <u>prokaryotic 70S vs eukaryotic 80S ribosomes</u>.",
    "Mechanism detail - Some exam questions describe an antibiotic-s action (e.g., blocking the peptidyl transferase or ribosomal translocation) and ask which cellular structure it affects - the answer would be the **bacterial ribosome** if it-s a protein synthesis inhibitor in bacteria.",
    "Identification - If asked to identify a -70S ribosome,- recognize it as a <u>prokaryotic (bacterial) ribosome</u>, typically found in bacteria (and similarly in mitochondria/chloroplasts of eukaryotes by origin)."
