  "definition": "**Diploid** describes a cell or organism that has <u>two complete sets of chromosomes</u>. In a diploid cell, chromosomes are in pairs - <u>one set inherited from each parent</u>. For example, human somatic cells are diploid with **46 chromosomes (23 pairs)**.",
  "tips": [
    "We often denote the diploid number as **2n**. For humans, <u>2n = 46</u>. This means n (the number of unique chromosomes) is 23, and having two sets (2x23) gives **46 total**.",
    "Nearly all cells in the human body (except gametes) are diploid. Having two sets of each chromosome also means having <u>two copies of each gene</u> (which can be the same allele or different alleles).",
    "Diploid organisms produce <u>haploid gametes through meiosis</u>. When two haploid gametes fuse at fertilization, the diploid number is restored in the offspring."

  "exam_appearance": [
    "Common question: \"How many chromosomes are in a human [or given organism] diploid cell?\" For humans, recognize the answer is **46 (in 23 pairs)**.",
    "Be careful with terminology: an exam might say \"2n = 14 for a certain species\" - that indicates diploid cells have 14 chromosomes total. You should then know <u>n = 7</u> (haploid number)."
