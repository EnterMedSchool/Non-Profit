  "why_it_matters": "The infantile form is often **fatal** by early childhood without treatment, whereas the adult form can be asymptomatic. Classic **\"bone-in-bone\"** x-ray findings and the contrast with **osteoporosis** make it a high-yield exam topic.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Dense, **sclerotic** bones that paradoxically break easily (excess bone but poor quality). Marrow space narrowing leads to **pancytopenia** with extramedullary hematopoiesis (**hepatosplenomegaly**). Cranial nerve compression from skull thickening causes vision and hearing loss, facial paralysis. Teeth may erupt late due to dense bone.",
    "Infantile (malignant, **AR**): presents in infancy with **failure to thrive**, pathologic fractures, **pancytopenia** (infections, bleeding), cranial nerve palsies (blindness, deafness), and enlarged liver/spleen. Often fatal if untreated.",
    "Adult (benign, **AD**, Albers-Schönberg): usually milder. May be discovered incidentally in adolescence/adulthood with **repeated fractures**, sometimes cranial nerve issues or arthritis. No marrow failure (near-normal blood counts), so life expectancy is generally normal."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Identify **osteosclerosis** on imaging: diffuse bony thickening with classic **\"bone-in-bone\"** appearance confirms osteopetrosis.",
    "Assess severity: check **CBC** for pancytopenia (marrow failure) and evaluate cranial nerve function (vision, hearing) in severe cases.",
    "Consider genetic testing to identify the mutated gene (e.g., **TCIRG1** in many AR cases, **CLCN7** in most AD cases).",
    "Infantile malignant osteopetrosis requires early **hematopoietic stem cell transplant** for survival. Adult benign osteopetrosis is managed supportively (fracture care, antibiotics for osteomyelitis, etc.)."

  "tricks": [

  "exam_appearance": [
    "Infant with fractures, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, cranial nerve deficits, and diffuse **bone-in-bone** sclerosis on X-ray → infantile (malignant) osteopetrosis.",
    "Adult with incidentally very dense bones on X-ray and history of multiple fractures → benign (adult) osteopetrosis (Albers-Schönberg disease)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Infantile (severe)**: early **hematopoietic stem cell transplant** (curative by providing functional osteoclasts).",
    "Supportive care for complications: blood transfusions for anemia, antibiotics for osteomyelitis, adequate calcium/vitamin D intake, etc.",
    "Interferon **γ** (Actimmune) can enhance bone resorption and immune function in severe cases, but transplant offers the best outcome."

  "algorithm": [
    "Suspect osteopetrosis if X-ray shows diffuse **osteosclerosis** (e.g., bone-in-bone).",

    "If infantile form, arrange prompt **HSCT** evaluation; provide supportive care (transfusions, infection prophylaxis).",
