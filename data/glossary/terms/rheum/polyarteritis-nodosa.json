  "definition": "Systemic necrotizing **vasculitis** of medium-sized muscular arteries causing ischemia and infarction in multiple organs. Characteristically **spares the lungs** and glomeruli. Often associated with hepatitis B infection.",
  "why_it_matters": "Life-threatening if untreated (5-year survival <15% without therapy). Early recognition allows aggressive immunosuppressive treatment to prevent **organ infarctions** (e.g., bowel, kidney, nerve). Also, PAN is a classic vasculitis on exams, highlighting key concepts like **HBV association**, **ANCA-negativity**, and the importance of distinguishing medium-vessel vs small-vessel vasculitides.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Insidious onset with constitutional symptoms (**fever**, weight loss, malaise, myalgias) followed by signs of medium-vessel ischemia in various organs. Adults (typically ages 40–60, male > female) often present with a combination of: **skin lesions** (painful subcutaneous nodules, livedo reticularis, ulcers); **mononeuritis multiplex** (asymmetric peripheral neuropathy leading to foot drop or hand weakness); **hypertension** (renal artery involvement); and abdominal pain (especially postprandial \"intestinal angina\") with gastrointestinal bleeding. **Kidney** involvement is typically via renal artery microaneurysms/infarcts rather than glomerulonephritis.",
    "Pediatric cases are rare, but **childhood PAN** can occur. Children may present with recurrent fever, skin nodules, and strokes (if a genetic cause like ADA2 enzyme deficiency is present). Unlike **Kawasaki disease** (another medium-vessel vasculitis in kids), PAN usually lacks mucocutaneous symptoms. A limited form, **cutaneous PAN**, causes chronic skin ulcers/nodules and is often less severe but can precede systemic disease."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Consider PAN in patients with unexplained systemic illness involving multiple organs (skin, nerves, kidney, GI) **without lung involvement**. Differentiate from ANCA-associated vasculitides: order **ANCA** testing (PAN is usually ANCA-negative) and note that presence of lung or glomerular involvement suggests alternate diagnoses (MPA/GPA).",
    "Always test for **hepatitis B** (HBsAg) in suspected PAN, since ~30% of cases are HBV-related and management includes antiviral therapy.",
    "Confirm diagnosis with tissue **biopsy** of an affected site (e.g., skin nodule, sural nerve, testis) showing transmural necrotizing arteritis with fibrinoid necrosis. If biopsy is not feasible, perform an **angiography** (usually mesenteric or renal): look for multiple small aneurysms and irregular constrictions (\"beads-on-a-string\" appearance, also called the **rosary sign**).",
    "Assess extent of organ involvement: monitor renal function (creatinine, urinalysis) and blood pressure (for renal ischemia); evaluate gastrointestinal symptoms with imaging (mesenteric ischemia can cause bowel perforation); and do a thorough neurologic exam (peripheral nerve deficits occur in ~70% of PAN cases)."

  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Corticosteroids** (high-dose prednisone ~1 mg/kg/day) are first-line and can induce remission. For severe disease (organ-threatening), add **cyclophosphamide** to improve survival (cyclophosphamide + steroids for induction).",
    "For **HBV-associated PAN**, prioritize treating the infection: start **antivirals** (e.g., entecavir) and use a shorter course of steroids ± **plasmapheresis** instead of prolonged cyclophosphamide (to avoid immunosuppression while virus is active).",
    "Manage complications and supportive care: aggressive **blood pressure control** (renin-driven hypertension is common, often requiring ACE inhibitors); monitor renal artery aneurysms (intervene if risk of rupture); and perform surgery if needed for bowel perforation or organ infarction."

  "algorithm": [

    "Order labs: inflammatory markers (↑ESR/CRP), comprehensive metabolic panel (for renal function, LFTs), and **HBV serologies**; **ANCA** testing helps exclude ANCA vasculitis (PAN is typically ANCA-negative).",
    "Confirm diagnosis: biopsy of involved tissue (e.g., skin, nerve) **or** angiography of mesenteric/renal arteries to demonstrate aneurysms.",
    "Start **high-dose corticosteroids** promptly. Add **cyclophosphamide** for moderate-to-severe disease (e.g., significant organ ischemia). If hepatitis B positive, initiate antiviral therapy (with limited steroid use and possible plasmapheresis).",
    "Follow closely: monitor blood pressure, renal function, and symptoms of organ ischemia. Address complications (e.g., dialysis for renal failure, surgery for GI perforation) as needed."
