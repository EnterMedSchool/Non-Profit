  "why_it_matters": "Life-threatening cause of alveolar hemorrhage & rapidly progressive GN that is fatal if untreated; early immunosuppression can save organs and lives.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, arthralgias) followed by **RPGN** (hematuria, RBC casts, ↑creatinine) ± **pulmonary capillaritis** (hemoptysis, cough, dyspnea) – classic pulmonary–renal syndrome.",
    "Renal-limited variant: isolated **pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis** without lung involvement (ANCA-positive rapidly progressive GN).",
    "Other features: **palpable purpura** (skin), mononeuritis multiplex (peripheral nerves), and sometimes GI vasculitis (abdominal pain). **Upper respiratory** tract involvement is notably absent (unlike GPA)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Order **ANCA** serologies: MPA is usually **MPO-ANCA** (p-ANCA) positive; also check **anti-GBM** to exclude Goodpasture's in pulmonary–renal cases.",
    "Confirm with tissue **biopsy** (often kidney): shows pauci-immune necrotizing vasculitis (crescentic GN) without granulomas.",
    "Determine disease severity (organ-threatening vs limited) – e.g., glomerulonephritis or alveolar hemorrhage necessitate aggressive therapy.",
    "Do not delay treatment in severe disease: start high-dose steroids + cyclophosphamide/rituximab promptly to prevent irreversible damage."

  "treatment": [
    "Remission induction: high-dose **corticosteroids** + either **cyclophosphamide** or **rituximab** (for severe organ-threatening disease). Use **methotrexate** or **MMF** only in mild cases (no critical organ involvement).",
    "Maintenance: after remission, switch to a less toxic agent for 1–2+ years (e.g., **azathioprine** or periodic rituximab) to prevent relapse.",
    "Adjuncts: consider **plasmapheresis** if life-threatening renal or pulmonary failure (controversial); give **PJP prophylaxis** (TMP-SMX) during intensive immunosuppression."

  "red_flags": [
    "Diffuse **alveolar hemorrhage** (hemoptysis, hypoxia, new infiltrates) → ICU-level emergency; requires immediate high-dose immunosuppression (risk of respiratory failure).",

  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Suspicion: patient with hematuria (± hemoptysis) and systemic inflammation → evaluate for ANCA-associated vasculitis.",
    "Initial workup: send **ANCA panel** (MPO & PR3); check anti-GBM; get chest imaging if respiratory symptoms; basic labs (creatinine, UA).",
    "Confirm diagnosis with **biopsy** of affected organ (often kidney) showing pauci-immune vasculitis (necrotizing GN).",
    "If organ-threatening disease, begin induction therapy immediately (do not wait for biopsy) – high-dose steroids + cyclophosphamide or rituximab (consider plasma exchange for very severe renal failure).",
    "After remission, continue **maintenance immunosuppression** (e.g., azathioprine or periodic rituximab) for 24–48 months; monitor for relapse."
