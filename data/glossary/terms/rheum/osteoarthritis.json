  "definition": "Chronic **degenerative** joint disease caused by wear-and-tear **cartilage** loss, resulting in bone spurs (*osteophytes*) and gradual joint destruction.",
  "why_it_matters": "OA is the **most common form of arthritis** and a leading cause of chronic joint pain and disability in older adults. Med students must recognize it and distinguish it from inflammatory arthritides (like RA) on exams and in practice.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Typically mid-older patients (≥50) with **weight-bearing** joint pain (knees, hips, spine) or hand OA (DIP **Heberden** nodes, PIP **Bouchard** nodes). Pain **worsens with activity** (especially later in the day) and improves with rest.",
    "**Morning stiffness** is brief (usually **<30 minutes**) – joints \"gel\" after inactivity but loosen up quickly (unlike RA's prolonged stiffness). Patients may report crepitus (a crackling joint sound) and joint stiffness after rest.",
    "Exam: bony joint enlargements (e.g. **Heberden nodes** at DIP joints), limited range of motion, and **crepitus** on movement. Knees often have a cool effusion; varus or valgus deformity can develop in advanced knee OA.",
    "Labs are typically normal (OA is non-inflammatory). Radiographs show **joint space narrowing**, **osteophytes**, **subchondral sclerosis**, and subchondral cysts."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Differentiate OA from **rheumatoid arthritis**: OA pain is mechanical (worse with use), with minimal morning stiffness and **DIP** involvement; RA is inflammatory (better with use) with prolonged stiffness and spares DIPs.",
    "Confirm suspected OA with a **weight-bearing X-ray** of the joint, which reveals characteristic changes (asymmetric cartilage loss, osteophytes, etc.). Synovial fluid in OA is non-inflammatory (WBC < 2000/mm³).",
    "Assess **red flags** (fever, redness, rapid onset, unusual age) that suggest alternative diagnoses (infection, crystal arthritis, inflammatory disease) instead of OA.",
    "Initial management is conservative for all OA patients: exercise (e.g. physical therapy to strengthen muscles around the joint) and **weight loss** if overweight. These lifestyle measures can significantly reduce pain and improve function."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "id": "rheumatoid-arthritis",
      "hint": "chronic **inflammatory** polyarthritis (small joints, symmetric, >30 min morning stiffness)"
    },
    {
      "id": "gout",
      "hint": "acute intermittent **monoarthritis** (red, extremely tender joint, often great toe); urate crystals"
    },
    {
      "id": "pseudogout",
      "name": "Pseudogout (CPPD)",
      "hint": "acute arthritis in older adults, often knee; chondrocalcinosis on X-ray (calcium pyrophosphate crystals)"
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "X-ray **LOSS** mnemonic for OA: **L**oss of joint space, **O**steophytes, **S**ubchondral sclerosis, **S**ubchondral cysts.",
    "Heberden nodes (bony bumps at DIP joints) and Bouchard nodes (PIP) are **classic for OA** (absent in RA).",
    "Think **\"wear and tear\"**: OA risk is increased by age, obesity, and prior joint injury – joints that have endured a lifetime of stress."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Overweight 60‑year‑old woman with chronic knee pain that worsens throughout the day and brief morning stiffness → osteoarthritis (degenerative knee arthritis).",
    "Older patient with hard bony enlargements at DIP and PIP joints (Heberden and Bouchard nodes), hand pain worse with use, and <30 min stiffness → hand OA."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Non-pharmacologic**: First-line is **exercise** (low-impact, plus muscle strengthening) and **weight loss**. Physical therapy and assistive devices (braces, canes) can help offload joints.",
    "**Analgesics**: Begin with **acetaminophen** for mild pain (safe but modest effect). **NSAIDs** (topical for hand/knee or oral if needed) provide stronger relief but use lowest effective dose and monitor for GI, renal, CV side effects. Topical capsaicin may help in hand OA; **duloxetine** is an option for chronic OA pain in some patients.",
    "**Injections**: Intra-articular **corticosteroid** injections can give short-term relief for painful flares (especially in knee/hip OA). Limit frequency (e.g. ~3–4 per year per joint). Viscosupplementation with hyaluronic acid injections is used in knee OA, though evidence for benefit is limited.",
    "**Surgery**: **Joint replacement** (total hip or knee arthroplasty) is highly effective for end-stage OA with severe pain and functional limitation. Consider orthopedic referral when conservative measures no longer maintain quality of life."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Joint is **red, hot, or swollen** or patient has **fever/chills** → not typical for OA; evaluate for **septic arthritis** or crystal arthritis (urgent intervention needed).",
    "**Extended morning stiffness** (>1 hour), **rapid joint destruction**, or systemic symptoms (fatigue, weight loss) → consider an **inflammatory arthritis** (like RA) or other pathology, not simple OA."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Chronic joint pain in older adult (especially knee, hip, hands) → suspect **osteoarthritis**.",
    "Evaluate for atypical features: if inflammation signs or unusual presentation, investigate for other diagnoses; otherwise proceed with OA management.",
    "Obtain X-rays of affected joints to confirm **OA changes** (joint space narrowing, osteophytes) and exclude alternative diagnoses.",
    "Begin **conservative management** for OA: patient education, exercise program, weight loss, and topical/oral analgesics as needed.",
    "If pain persists and significantly limits function despite conservative therapy → escalate care (consider corticosteroid injections, and if severe, refer for possible joint **replacement**)."
