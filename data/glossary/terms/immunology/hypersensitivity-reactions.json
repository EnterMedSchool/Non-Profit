  "why_it_matters": "Hypersensitivity mechanisms underlie extremely **common conditions** (e.g. hay fever affects ~1 in 10 people worldwide, asthma hundreds of millions, autoimmune diseases ~1 in 12). They can also be **life-threatening** (e.g. anaphylaxis). Recognizing the type of reaction guides diagnosis (allergy testing vs autoantibody assays) and appropriate therapy (e.g. epinephrine for anaphylaxis vs immunosuppression for autoimmunity). These classifications are frequently tested on exams.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "🔴 **Type I (Immediate IgE-mediated)** – Classic **allergic reactions** occurring within minutes of exposure: urticaria (hives), itching, bronchospasm (wheezing), angioedema (swelling), hypotension. Triggers are typically environmental allergens (foods, pollen, insect stings, drugs, latex, etc.), and severe cases present as **anaphylaxis**.",
    "🟠 **Type II (Cytotoxic IgG/IgM-mediated)** – **Organ-specific** autoimmune or drug-induced reactions. Antibodies target cells or ECM, causing tissue-specific damage. Examples: **hemolytic anemia** or thrombocytopenia (antibody-coated cells destroyed → pallor, jaundice, bleeding), **Goodpasture syndrome** (anti-GBM antibodies → lung hemorrhage + glomerulonephritis with hemoptysis and hematuria), or pemphigus/bullous pemphigoid (antibodies to skin components → blistering).",
    "🟡 **Type III (Immune complex-mediated)** – **Immune complex** deposition causes systemic or localized inflammation, typically with a **delayed onset** (days to weeks after antigen exposure). Presents with **vasculitic** features: e.g. **serum sickness** (fever, rash, arthritis ~1 week after antiserum/drug exposure), **post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis** (hematuria after strep infection), or **lupus** (immune complexes affect joints, kidneys, etc.). Findings often include **complement activation** (potentially low C3/C4) and neutrophil-rich inflammation.",
    "🟢 **Type IV (Delayed T-cell-mediated)** – **Delayed (>48h)** inflammatory reactions mediated by sensitized T lymphocytes, not antibodies. Examples: **contact dermatitis** (e.g. poison ivy or nickel rash developing 1–2 days after contact), **tuberculin skin test** (induration peaks ~48–72h), **transplant rejection** and **granulomatous inflammation** (like in TB or sarcoidosis) due to Th1-cell activation of macrophages. Often presents with erythema, itching or tissue-specific damage without any detectable antibodies."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "**Timing is key:** classify by onset after exposure – **minutes** suggests Type I; **hours** suggests Type II or III; **48–72 hours** suggests Type IV.",
    "**Identify the immunologic mechanism:** look for evidence of IgE (**allergy test** positive → Type I), specific autoantibodies (e.g. **Coombs** or anti-tissue antibody → Type II), circulating **immune complexes** (low complement levels, granular immunofluorescence on biopsy → Type III), or T-cell involvement (e.g. contact **patch test** positive → Type IV).",
    "**Diagnostic tests:** Use **skin prick tests** or allergen-specific IgE levels for suspected Type I (immediate) allergies; direct/indirect **Coombs tests** for antibody-mediated cytotoxic reactions (Type II); check complement levels, immune complex assays, or tissue biopsy (immunofluorescence) for immune complex disease (Type III); and perform **patch testing** for contact (Type IV) allergies.",
    "**Mechanistic clues:** Type II reactions tend to be localized to specific tissues (e.g. one organ system affected), whereas Type III often cause **multisystem** or **vasculitic** manifestations due to complexes circulating. Recognize patterns like linear vs granular deposition on immunofluorescence (linear in anti-GBM disease = Type II vs granular in immune complex GN = Type III) to distinguish mechanisms."

    "Types **I, II, III** are all **antibody-mediated** (Type I involves IgE; II and III involve IgG/IgM), whereas Type **IV** is the only one mediated by **T cells** (no antibodies involved).",
    "**Type II** can cause **cell destruction** (via complement/phagocytes, e.g. hemolysis) or **cellular dysfunction** without cell death (antibodies acting as agonist or blocker, e.g. **Graves disease** or **myasthenia gravis**). USMLE classifies both as Type II hypersensitivity.",
    "**Type III** reactions often consume **complement** (e.g. low C3/C4 in lupus or serum sickness) due to widespread immune complex activation of the complement cascade. Think immune complexes → **vasculitis** and **neutrophils** (e.g. **post-strep GN**, serum sickness)."

  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Type I (Immediate):** Ensure airway; give **epinephrine** IM promptly for anaphylaxis. Adjuncts include **antihistamines** for urticaria, **bronchodilators** for bronchospasm, and **corticosteroids** to reduce late-phase inflammation. Long-term, emphasize **allergen avoidance** and consider **desensitization immunotherapy** for severe recurrent allergies.",
    "**Type II (Cytotoxic):** Remove or treat the offending agent (e.g. stop the drug, treat infection). **Immunosuppressive therapy** is mainstay – typically high-dose **glucocorticoids** to reduce antibody production and inflammation. In severe cases, add **IVIG** (to neutralize pathogenic antibodies) or perform **plasmapheresis** to directly remove antibodies (e.g. in Goodpasture syndrome). Preventive measure: for hemolytic disease of newborn (Rh incompatibility), give RhoGAM to Rh– mothers.",
    "**Type III (Immune complex):** Address underlying cause (treat infection, discontinue offending drug) and use **immunosuppressants** to dampen ongoing inflammation. **Corticosteroids** are often used (e.g. for lupus nephritis or serum sickness) to reduce immune complex deposition damage. For chronic immune complex diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, steroid-sparing agents (**DMARDs** such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or biologics like TNF inhibitors) are employed.",
    "**Type IV (Delayed):** **Avoid the trigger** allergen or antigen when possible (e.g. known contact allergens). For allergic contact dermatitis, use **topical corticosteroids** to reduce inflammation; more severe reactions may require **systemic steroids** with a taper. In severe T-cell mediated reactions like **Stevens–Johnson syndrome**, hospitalize for supportive care (fluid/electrolyte management, wound care). Chronic Type IV conditions (e.g. transplant rejection, autoimmune) may need potent immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, etc.)."

    "Classify as Type I, II, III, or IV and **treat accordingly**: e.g. antihistamines/steroids for Type I allergies, immunosuppression or plasmapheresis for antibody-mediated Type II/III, and avoidance + steroids for Type IV. Ensure removal of or avoidance of the triggering antigen in all cases."
