  "definition": "X-linked recessive immunodeficiency caused by a **BTK gene** mutation, resulting in failure of B cell maturation and near-absent immunoglobulins (agammaglobulinemia).",
  "why_it_matters": "Classic pediatric **primary immunodeficiency** often tested on exams; fatal infections or organ damage can occur if not recognized and treated early (first immunodeficiency described, by Bruton).",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Healthy for first few months of life (maternal IgG), then recurrent **bacterial** infections begin ~6–9 months (after maternal antibodies wane). **Otitis media**, pneumonia, sinusitis are common; infections often severe and require hospitalization.",
    "Encapsulated bacteria like **Streptococcus pneumoniae** and **Haemophilus influenzae** are typical pathogens (due to lack of opsonizing Ig); also chronic diarrhea from **Giardia** (no IgA), and risk of severe **enteroviral** infections (e.g., polio, echovirus encephalitis).",
    "Exam: absence of lymphoid tissue (**tonsils**, adenoids) and no lymphadenopathy (reflecting lack of B cells); spleen and liver typically normal (no lymphoid hyperplasia)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect XLA in a baby boy with >1 serious bacterial infection after age 6mo; confirm with immunoglobulin levels and B-cell counts.",
    "Labs: **IgG**, **IgM**, **IgA** all markedly low (often undetectable). **Flow cytometry** shows profoundly low **CD19+ B cells** (<2% of lymphocytes) with normal T cell number.",
    "Physical exam clues: no palpable tonsils or lymph nodes suggests absence of B cells (seen in XLA).",
    "Genetic testing for **BTK mutation** can confirm the diagnosis. A family history of males with early fatal infections may be present (X-linked recessive).",
    "Avoid administering **live vaccines** (polio, rotavirus, MMR, varicella) in infants suspected of immunodeficiency until evaluation, as they can cause infection in XLA."

      "id": "severe-combined-immunodeficiency",

    },
    {
      "id": "hyper-igm-syndrome",

      "id": "selective-iga-deficiency",
      "hint": "IgA is low (not all Igs); milder recurrent mucosal infections, often asymptomatic"

  "tricks": [
    "Think **B**ruton's for **B**-cells (absent), **B**oys (X-linked), and infections starting at **B**abies age ~6 months.",
    "No **B** cells → no **B**rainer: no tonsils! (Tonsillar tissue underdeveloped without B cells)."

    "8-month-old boy with recurrent otitis media, pneumonia (since 6 months) and absent tonsils → **X-linked agammaglobulinemia** (Bruton's).",
    "Infant develops paralytic poliovirus infection after oral polio vaccine → suspect XLA (can't form antibodies to live vaccine)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Lifelong **immunoglobulin replacement** (monthly IVIG or weekly SCIG) to provide missing antibodies (significantly reduces infections).",
    "Antibiotics for acute infections (aggressive therapy); consider prophylactic antibiotics to prevent recurrent sinopulmonary infections.",
    "No live vaccines (e.g., oral polio, varicella); ensure siblings' vaccines are up-to-date to protect the patient (herd immunity)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Recurrent severe infections in infancy, especially after 6mo, or **vaccine-derived infection** (e.g., from rotavirus or polio vaccine) → evaluate immune function (could be XLA).",
    "Delayed diagnosis can lead to **bronchiectasis** from repeated pneumonias or chronic enteroviral encephalitis — start IVIG early to prevent organ damage."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Recurrent bacterial infections in male infant (>6mo) → suspect XLA.",
    "Order quantitative Ig levels (expect pan-hypogammaglobulinemia) and lymphocyte immunophenotype (expect <2% B cells).",
    "If Ig levels low + B cells absent → XLA likely; confirm with BTK genetic testing.",
    "Begin IVIG replacement therapy promptly; treat active infections with appropriate antibiotics.",
    "Avoid live vaccines; provide genetic counseling (X-linked inheritance)."
