  "definition": "Primary antibody immunodeficiency with **hypogammaglobulinemia** (low IgG plus low IgA/IgM) causing recurrent infections and immune dysregulation (autoimmunity).",
  "why_it_matters": "Most common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency; leads to recurrent **sinopulmonary infections**, chronic lung damage (bronchiectasis), frequent **autoimmune** diseases (e.g., ITP, hemolytic anemia), and increased **lymphoma** risk.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Usually presents in **teens or adults** (but sometimes after age 4); recurrent **otitis**, **sinusitis**, **pneumonia** are typical. Chronic **diarrhea** (often from Giardia) is also common.",
    "Autoimmune complications (e.g., cytopenias like ITP or AIHA, thyroid disease) and **non-caseating granulomas** (sarcoid-like lung or lymphoid lesions) can occur, adding to the variable features.",
    "Labs: **↓ IgG** (with ↓IgA and/or ↓IgM) and **poor vaccine antibody response** (no protective titers after immunizations). **B cells are present** (normal or low-normal count, unlike XLA)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect CVID in older children or adults with recurrent bacterial infections affecting ears, sinuses, lungs (and sometimes chronic diarrhea).",
    "First, check quantitative immunoglobulin levels: significantly low IgG (≥2 SD below normal for age) with low IgA and/or IgM confirms hypogammaglobulinemia.",
    "Test antibody function: measure specific antibody titers after vaccines (e.g., pneumococcal vaccine) – CVID patients show **poor or absent response** despite vaccination.",
    "Exclude secondary causes of low immunoglobulins: test for **HIV**; evaluate for protein loss (**nephrotic syndrome** or protein-losing enteropathy); review medications (e.g., immunosuppressants, anti-seizure drugs); rule out lymphoid malignancy (CLL, myeloma).",
    "Distinguish from other primary immunodeficiencies: CVID has **normal B-cell numbers** and later onset in both sexes (vs. X-linked agammaglobulinemia – no B cells, infant boys; vs. hyper-IgM – high IgM; vs. SCID – T-cell deficits and infant onset)."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "name": "X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton)",
      "hint": "Male infant with recurrent infections starting ~6mo; **no B cells** on flow cytometry, all Ig classes low."
    },
    {
      "name": "Selective IgA deficiency",
      "hint": "**IgA** low, but IgG/IgM normal; may have recurrent mucosal infections but often asymptomatic; most common immunoglobulin deficiency."
    },
    {
      "name": "Hyper-IgM syndrome",
      "hint": "High IgM, very low IgG/IgA; often X-linked (CD40L defect); presents in infancy with severe sinopulmonary and opportunistic infections."
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Remember **CVID** as **Common & Variable**: the most common clinically significant immunodeficiency with highly variable presentation (infections + autoimmunity + granulomas).",
    "**Bruton**'s agammaglobulinemia = **Boys, Babies, B-cells absent**; **CVID** = **Co-ed, Variable age**, B-cells **Present** (just can't class-switch well)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Young adult with recurrent sinus infections, pneumonias, and chronic diarrhea (Giardia) who has low immunoglobulin levels → **Common variable immunodeficiency**.",
    "10‑year‑old girl with a history of multiple pneumonias and otitis media, plus an episode of autoimmune thrombocytopenia, found to have low IgG and IgA levels → **CVID** (distinguish from XLA by female sex and presence of B cells).",
    "Adult CVID patient with chronic cough and lung nodules on CT is found to have non-caseating granulomas (GLILD) → indicates CVID-related granulomatous disease (not sarcoidosis)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Immunoglobulin replacement** therapy for life (regular IVIG or SCIG infusions) to restore IgG levels and reduce infections.",
    "Aggressive treatment of infections (antibiotics); consider prophylactic antibiotics if needed for recurrent bacterial infections.",
    "No live vaccines (they often won't mount response; use inactivated vaccines in close contacts instead for herd protection).",
    "Monitor for complications: manage autoimmune disorders (e.g., IVIG also helps ITP), screen for lymphoma if persistent lymphadenopathy or organ enlargement, and perform lung imaging/PFTs if chronic respiratory symptoms (for bronchiectasis or GLILD)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Unexplained **weight loss**, chronic diarrhea, or abdominal pain in CVID → evaluate for GI involvement (sprue-like enteropathy) or GI lymphoma.",
    "Recurrent pneumonia in CVID patient → get imaging; early **bronchiectasis** can develop, requiring pulmonary care (airway clearance, possibly prophylactic antibiotics).",
    "**Hepatosplenomegaly** or lymph node enlargement in CVID → consider lymphoma (much higher risk in CVID) and pursue appropriate workup (imaging/biopsy)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Recurrent respiratory or GI infections in child >4 or adult → suspect CVID (check immunoglobulin levels).",
    "**Low IgG (and low IgA/IgM)** on two occasions → proceed to functional antibody testing (vaccine titers).",
    "Confirm poor antibody response to vaccines or isohemagglutinins → supports CVID diagnosis.",
    "Exclude secondary immunodeficiencies (HIV, protein loss, medications, malignancy) and other primary IDs (if male infant with no B cells, that's XLA; if severe T-cell defects, think SCID).",
    "Diagnosis of exclusion confirmed → begin **IVIG** therapy and routine monitoring (infections, autoimmunity, malignancy surveillance)."
