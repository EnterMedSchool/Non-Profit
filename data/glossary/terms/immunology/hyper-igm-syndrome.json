  "definition": "Primary immunodeficiency where B cells cannot class-switch, leading to normal or elevated **IgM** but very low **IgG**, **IgA**, **IgE** levels.",
  "why_it_matters": "Leads to severe, often life-threatening infections in infancy (including opportunistic infections like **Pneumocystis pneumonia**). Highlights the critical role of T–B cell interactions (the CD40–CD40L handshake) in immune function and is a classic high-yield immunodeficiency.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Usually presents in early childhood with recurrent **sinopulmonary infections** (e.g., otitis media, pneumonia) once maternal IgG wanes, often accompanied by poor growth (failure to thrive).",
    "Opportunistic infections are a hallmark: infants may develop **Pneumocystis jirovecii** pneumonia and chronic **Cryptosporidium** diarrhea (which can lead to cholangitis).",
    "**Neutropenia** is common in X-linked HIGM, causing mouth ulcers and skin infections. Lymphoid tissues (tonsils, lymph nodes) are often diminished due to lack of germinal centers in CD40L deficiency."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Measure immunoglobulin levels in any infant with recurrent infections: **high IgM** coupled with **low IgG/IgA** is the diagnostic pattern for Hyper IgM syndrome.",
    "Confirm the cause by checking **CD40 ligand (CD40L)** expression on T cells (flow cytometry) and genetic testing. An absent CD40L in a boy indicates the X-linked form; other gene defects (AID, CD40) cause rare autosomal recessive forms.",
    "Differentiate from other immunodeficiencies: **X-linked agammaglobulinemia** has low Ig of all types and absent B cells (vs. normal B cells and IgM in HIGM); **SCID** presents earlier with even more profound T-cell dysfunction (e.g., severe viral/fungal infections); **CVID** presents later in life.",
    "Poor vaccine responses (due to inability to class-switch and form IgG antibodies) and lack of germinal centers on lymphoid biopsy are clues pointing to hyper IgM (especially the X-linked CD40L form).",
    "Determine inheritance: X-linked HIGM (CD40L gene mutation) accounts for ~70% of cases and affects only boys. Autosomal recessive types (e.g., **AID** or **CD40** mutations) affect both sexes and can show extremely high IgM with enlarged lymphoid tissues."

  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Think **M for Male** and **M for IgM**: the most common HIGM is X-linked (affecting boys) and features high IgM with other isotypes Missing.",
    "No **CD40L–CD40** handshake: without T-cell CD40 ligand, B cells never get the class-switch signal, so they remain stuck making IgM."

  "exam_appearance": [
    "Infant boy with recurrent ear infections, **Pneumocystis pneumonia**, and extremely low IgG/IgA but high IgM levels → X-linked Hyper IgM syndrome.",
    "Toddler with chronic **Cryptosporidium** diarrhea leading to cholangitis, found to have high IgM and low IgG/A levels → Hyper IgM immunodeficiency."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**IVIG** (intravenous Ig) replacement therapy to supply missing IgG and reduce infections.",
    "**Antimicrobial prophylaxis**: e.g., daily **TMP-SMX** to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia (especially in CD40L deficiency); plus precautions to avoid Cryptosporidium (boiled water, etc).",
    "**Hematopoietic stem cell transplant** (bone marrow transplant) offers a potential cure and is recommended if an appropriate donor is available.",
    "Treat neutropenia with **G-CSF** (filgrastim) if severe."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Pneumocystis jirovecii** pneumonia in an infant (unusual outside HIV/immunodeficiency) → evaluate for Hyper IgM or SCID.",
    "Recurrent severe bacterial infections starting at ~6–12 months old (after maternal IgG wanes) → suspect a primary immunodeficiency (like HIGM)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Recurrent infections in infancy (esp. with opportunistic pathogens) → suspect primary immunodeficiency.",
    "Obtain quantitative immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, IgM).",
    "If **IgM high** with **IgG/IgA low** → likely **Hyper IgM syndrome**.",
    "Confirm with CD40L protein testing and genetic analysis (to identify X-linked vs AR type).",
    "Initiate therapy: IVIG infusions, antimicrobial prophylaxis (e.g., TMP-SMX), and refer for possible HSCT."
