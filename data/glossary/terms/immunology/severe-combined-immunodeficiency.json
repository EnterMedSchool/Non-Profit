  "definition": "A group of rare **inherited immunodeficiencies** characterized by profound T- and B-cell dysfunction, leading to extreme vulnerability to infections in early infancy.",
  "why_it_matters": "SCID is the most severe primary immunodeficiency—**fatal in infancy without treatment**. Early detection (newborn TREC screening) allows timely **curative therapy** (e.g. bone marrow transplant), transforming an otherwise lethal disease.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Onset at **3–6 months** of age (after maternal IgG wanes) with recurrent **severe infections**: e.g. persistent thrush, chronic diarrhea, **Pneumocystis** pneumonia; **failure to thrive**.",
    "Opportunistic pathogens (fungal, viral, protozoal) and high susceptibility to live vaccine strains (e.g. rotavirus) due to absent T-cell immunity.",
    "Physical exam: absence of lymphoid tissue (**no tonsils, no lymph nodes**); **absent thymic shadow** on chest X-ray (thymic aplasia).",
    "Lab findings: **lymphopenia** (especially very low T cells); B cells may be present but nonfunctional (require T help). Newborn screening shows very low/absent **TREC** levels (T-cell receptor excision circles)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Maternal IgG protects newborns for ~6 months; consider SCID in infants who appear healthy at birth but then develop severe infections after a few months.",
    "**X-linked** SCID (IL2RG gene) is most common (∼50%, only in boys); autosomal recessive forms include **ADA** deficiency, **JAK3** mutation, **RAG1/2** mutations, etc., each causing distinct T/B/NK cell absence patterns.",
    "Differentiate from other causes of T-cell lymphopenia: e.g. **DiGeorge syndrome** (thymic aplasia) also lacks T cells but presents with cardiac defects & hypocalcemia; **HIV infection** in infants can cause opportunistic infections but usually has maternal risk factors and positive HIV PCR."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "name": "DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion)",
      "hint": "Congenital thymic aplasia → T-cell deficiency, but also cardiac defects and hypocalcemia (not seen in SCID)."
    },
    {
      "name": "Perinatal HIV infection",
      "hint": "Opportunistic infections in infancy if maternal HIV+, distinguish by maternal history and positive infant HIV PCR."
    },
    {
      "name": "Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome",
      "hint": "Combined immunodef with thrombocytopenia & eczema; T cells low but B cells present (high IgE/IgA)."
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "The classic **\"bubble boy\"** scenario refers to SCID infants kept in sterile isolation.",
    "**Maternal IgG wanes by 3–6 months** – that's when SCID manifests with infections (early newborn period is often protected)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Infant (~4–6 months old) with **oral thrush**, chronic diarrhea, **Pneumocystis pneumonia**, and no thymic shadow on CXR → think SCID (X-linked IL2RG deficiency).",
    "Newborn develops disseminated infection from a **live vaccine** (e.g. BCG or rotavirus) → suspect SCID (inability to handle attenuated pathogens)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)** as early as possible (ideally in the first 3–4 months) offers cure by reconstituting the immune system.",
    "**Gene therapy** has been successful in some SCID types (e.g. IL2RG X-linked SCID, ADA-SCID); ADA deficiency can also be treated with **PEG-ADA enzyme replacement**.",
    "Supportive care: **IVIG** (IV immunoglobulin) to provide antibodies, **prophylactic antimicrobials** (e.g. TMP-SMX for PCP, antifungals), and strict infection precautions (sterile environment, no live vaccines).",
    "If SCID is suspected or confirmed, **isolate the infant** and avoid exposures; even maternal CMV (from breast milk) can be dangerous if donor milk isn't screened."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Severe reactions to **live vaccines** (e.g. disseminated BCG or rotavirus infection) in an infant – red flag for SCID, requires immediate evaluation.",
    "Infant with **persistent thrush**, **failure to thrive**, and recurrent infections – evaluate immediately for SCID (it's a medical emergency)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Newborn **screening (TREC)** is low or infant has lymphopenia/infections → **suspect SCID** and urgently consult immunology.",
    "Confirm with **flow cytometry** (absent T cells, ± B/NK cells) and **genetic testing** for specific mutation.",
    "Begin protective measures: reverse isolation, no live vaccines, **broad prophylaxis** (antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, PCP prophylaxis, IVIG).",
    "**Definitive treatment**: prompt **HSCT** from a matched donor (or gene therapy if available) for long-term cure."
