  "definition": "Rare **autosomal recessive** immunodeficiency characterized by partial oculocutaneous albinism, recurrent pyogenic infections, and peripheral neuropathy. **Hallmark**: giant intracytoplasmic granules in leukocytes due to a LYST gene mutation disrupting lysosomal trafficking.",
  "why_it_matters": "CHS is often **fatal in childhood** without early intervention. Patients can develop a life-threatening **accelerated phase** (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) with overwhelming infections and organ failure. Recognizing the classic triad (albinism, infections, neuropathy) and **giant granules** on smear allows timely curative therapy.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Infant or child with **silvery hair, light skin** (partial albinism) and frequent severe infections (skin, mucous membranes, respiratory) by *Staph aureus* or *Strep*; may have **nystagmus** and easy bruising.",
    "Labs: often **neutropenia**; peripheral smear shows neutrophils with **giant azurophilic granules** (pathognomonic).",
    "Progressive **peripheral neuropathy** (weakness, sensory loss) becomes apparent in later childhood.",
    "An **accelerated phase** (hemophagocytic syndrome) may occur, with fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia due to lymphohistiocytic infiltration."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect CHS in a child with albinism + recurrent bacterial infections (especially *S. aureus*); order a **blood smear** to look for giant granules in leukocytes.",
    "Confirm diagnosis with **LYST** genetic testing. Evaluate for organ involvement and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis if fevers or cytopenias are present.",
    "Initiate **prophylactic antibiotics** and rigorous infection control. Consider **G-CSF** for neutropenia to boost neutrophil counts.",
    "Plan for **allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)** as early as possible – the only cure for the immune and hematologic defects."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "id": "chronic-granulomatous-disease",
      "hint": "X-linked phagocyte oxidase defect with recurrent infections, but **no albinism**; normal neutrophil granules."
    },
    {
      "name": "Griscelli syndrome (type 2)",
      "hint": "Silvery hair & immunodeficiency with HLH episodes (mutated Rab27a); similar albinism but distinct genetic cause."
    },
    {
      "name": "Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome",
      "hint": "Albinism with bleeding (platelet storage pool disease); **no recurrent infections** or immunodeficiency."
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic – **3 P's** of CHS: **P**artial albinism, **P**yogenic infections, **P**eripheral neuropathy.",
    "Think **Chediak = Colossal granules** – neutrophils show giant fused lysosomal granules on smear."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Pale-skinned, light-haired child with recurrent skin and lung infections (often *Staph aureus*) and **giant granules in neutrophils** on peripheral smear → Chediak-Higashi syndrome.",
    "Patient with known CHS develops high fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and coagulopathy → **Accelerated phase** (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Allogeneic bone marrow transplant** is the definitive treatment (ideally performed before progressive neurologic degeneration).",
    "Aggressive antimicrobial therapy for active infections; use **granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)** for neutropenia as needed.",
    "If in accelerated phase (HLH): initiate an **HLH protocol** (etoposide-based chemoimmunotherapy) to control hyperinflammation, then proceed to transplant.",
    "Supportive: high-dose **vitamin C** has been reported to partially improve neutrophil function and bleeding; give platelet transfusions for bleeding, and provide vision aids/rehabilitation for neurologic sequelae."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Unexplained fever, organomegaly, and cytopenias** in a CHS patient → suspect accelerated HLH phase, a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment.",
    "Delayed HSCT: ongoing neurologic decline in CHS is **irreversible** – even after transplant the immune defects are cured but neuropathy can progress."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Recognize: Albinism + recurrent infections → suspect CHS; obtain CBC and peripheral **smear** for giant granules.",
    "Confirm: Genetic testing for **LYST** mutation; consider screening siblings (autosomal recessive inheritance).",
    "Stabilize: Treat active infections (broad-spectrum antibiotics, drain abscesses) and provide supportive care (G-CSF for neutropenia, vitamin C, transfusions as needed).",
    "Definitive: Arrange **hematopoietic stem cell transplant** as early as possible (curative); if HLH has developed, treat with HLH protocol before transplant."

  "cases": [
    {
      "stem": "A 4-year-old boy with silvery-blond hair and pale skin has had multiple severe skin and lung infections since infancy. On exam, he has horizontal nystagmus and several bruises. Laboratory results show neutropenia; a blood smear reveals neutrophils with giant cytoplasmic granules.",

      "answer": "Chediak-Higashi syndrome (lysosomal trafficking regulator gene mutation)",
      "teaching": "This presentation of albinism, pyogenic infections, and neuropathy is classic for CHS. A mutation in *LYST* causes microtubule/lysosomal trafficking dysfunction and **giant granules** in leukocytes, leading to immunodeficiency and bleeding tendency. Definitive treatment is early bone marrow transplant."

      "stem": "An 8-year-old girl with known Chediak-Higashi syndrome presents with 2 weeks of high fever, jaundice, and bleeding gums. She appears pale with generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests show pancytopenia, high ferritin, and evidence of DIC.",

      "teaching": "In ~85% of CHS patients, an accelerated \"lymphoma-like\" phase (essentially secondary HLH) occurs. Uncontrolled activation of lymphocytes and macrophages causes fever, cytopenias, and multiorgan failure. Management requires urgent HLH-directed chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant."
