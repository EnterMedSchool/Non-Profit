  "definition": "Rare autosomal dominant disorder causing deficiency or dysfunction of C1 esterase inhibitor; leads to recurrent episodes of **bradykinin-mediated angioedema** without urticaria.",
  "why_it_matters": "Attacks can be life-threatening (airway obstruction risk); must recognize HAE to give specific therapy (C1-INH, etc.) rather than ineffective epinephrine/steroids.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Recurrent episodes of **nonpitting edema** (face, lips, tongue, extremities, GI tract) without urticaria or pruritus.",
    "Often triggered by minor trauma (e.g., dental work), stress, or high estrogen (OCPs, pregnancy); attacks typically last 2–5 days.",
    "Labs: **↓ C4** (usually low even between attacks); **↓ C1-INH** antigen level (Type I) or function (Type II); normal C1-INH studies in Type III."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Ensure airway protection first if laryngeal edema (early intubation or cricothyrotomy).",
    "Acute attack: treat promptly with **C1-INH** concentrate or **bradykinin-targeted** therapy (e.g., **icatibant** or **ecallantide**); consider FFP if specific meds unavailable.",
    "Long-term prophylaxis: if attacks are frequent/severe, use **lanadelumab** (anti-kallikrein mAb), attenuated **androgens** (e.g., danazol), or regular C1-INH infusions; **antifibrinolytics** (e.g., tranexamic acid) are less effective alternatives.",
    "Short-term prophylaxis: before procedures (especially dental), give C1-INH prior or a high-dose androgen starting ~5 days before (avoid androgens in pregnancy).",
    "Differentiate from allergic angioedema: HAE has no urticaria and does not respond to epinephrine (requires C1-INH or bradykinin antagonist)."

  "differentials": [

      "name": "Allergic (histamine-mediated) angioedema",

      "hint": "late-onset angioedema due to C1-INH autoantibody (associated with lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disease)"
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "HAE has **no hives** — angioedema with urticaria is likely allergic (histamine-mediated).",
    "**Epinephrine & antihistamines don't work** for HAE (bradykinin-mediated) — use C1-INH or icatibant instead.",
    "Family history can be absent (≈25% are new mutations), so consider HAE even without known affected relatives."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Young patient with recurrent face/lip swelling **without urticaria**, often after dental work or stress → hereditary angioedema.",
    "Severe abdominal pain with vomiting and normal endoscopy (mimicking an acute abdomen) → think HAE (intestinal angioedema)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Acute attacks** – secure airway as needed; give **C1-INH** concentrate or bradykinin-targeted therapy (**icatibant** or **ecallantide**). (FFP can be used if specific therapies unavailable.)",
    "**Chronic prophylaxis** – e.g., **lanadelumab** injections q2–4 weeks, daily attenuated **androgens** (danazol), or tranexamic acid to reduce attack frequency.",
    "**Pre-procedure prophylaxis** – short course of high-dose androgen starting 5 days prior, or give C1-INH before high-risk procedures (especially dental work)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Laryngeal swelling (hoarseness, stridor) — risk of asphyxiation; **intubate immediately**.",
    "Severe abdominal attack + normal imaging — consider HAE (to avoid unnecessary surgery)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Recurrent angioedema without urticaria → check **C4** level and C1-INH antigen/function.",
    "If **↓ C4** with low C1-INH level or function → HAE Type I/II confirmed. Normal C1-INH but high suspicion → consider HAE with normal C1-INH (Type III, often **F12** gene mutation).",
    "Acute management: secure airway, then treat with C1-INH or bradykinin antagonist (do NOT rely on epinephrine/steroids).",
    "Prophylaxis: start long-term therapy if frequent attacks; give short-term prophylaxis before known triggers (e.g., dental procedures)."
