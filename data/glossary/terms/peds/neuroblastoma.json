  "definition": "Embryonal tumor of the sympathetic nervous system (neural crest origin), usually arising in the adrenal medulla or paraspinal ganglia; most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood.",
  "why_it_matters": "Often lethal if high-risk (~15% of childhood cancer deaths) yet some low-risk tumors spontaneously regress. Unique features (catecholamine secretion, paraneoplastic syndromes) and classic comparisons (e.g., vs Wilms tumor) make it a high-yield pediatric malignancy.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Infant or toddler with a firm, irregular abdominal mass (often adrenal) that can cross the midline; may have weight loss, irritability.",
    "Frequently metastatic at presentation: bone pain or limp (bone metastases), periorbital ecchymoses (\"raccoon eyes\" from orbital mets), or bluish subcutaneous nodules (\"blueberry muffin\" skin mets).",
    "Paraneoplastic syndromes: **opsoclonus-myoclonus** (\"dancing eyes, dancing feet\" jerky eye movements and ataxia) or intractable diarrhea (from VIP secretion).",
    "Thoracic or cervical tumor involvement: **Horner syndrome** (ptosis, miosis) if sympathetic chain is affected; paraspinal masses can extend into spinal canal and cause cord compression (weakness, paralysis)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Obtain urinary catecholamine metabolites (**VMA, HVA**) in any young child with an unexplained abdominal mass (elevated in >90% of neuroblastomas).",
    "Differentiate **neuroblastoma vs Wilms tumor**: neuroblastoma usually in infants (<2 yr) with an adrenal mass that often crosses midline and causes systemic symptoms (↑catecholamines); Wilms typically in slightly older children (~3–4 yr) with a unilateral kidney mass, often asymptomatic (±hematuria or HTN).",
    "Once diagnosed, complete staging with imaging (**MRI/CT** and **m**IBG scan) and bone marrow biopsies; risk stratification is based on **age**, **stage**, and tumor biology (**N-MYC** amplification, ploidy, histology)."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "id": "wilms-tumor",
      "name": "Wilms tumor",
      "hint": "kidney (nephroblastoma) tumor at age ~3–4; smooth unilateral flank mass (does not cross midline), often hematuria or hypertension"
    },
    {
      "id": "burkitt-lymphoma",
      "name": "Burkitt lymphoma",
      "hint": "abdominal tumor in older child; very rapid growth (high LDH), often ileocecal, associated with tumor lysis syndrome"
    },
    {
      "id": "pheochromocytoma",
      "hint": "catecholamine-producing adrenal medulla tumor (episodic hypertension, tachycardia) but extremely rare in young children"
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Think **VMA/HVA** for **N**euro**B**lastoma – urine catecholamine metabolites are elevated in most cases.",
    "**Opsoclonus-myoclonus** (dancing eyes and feet) in a young child is a classic clue to neuroblastoma (paraneoplastic).",
    "Unique **Stage 4S**: in infants <1 yr, metastatic neuroblastoma (limited to skin, liver, marrow) can **spontaneously regress** with minimal therapy."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Infant with a firm abdominal mass crossing midline, weight loss, and elevated urine VMA → **Neuroblastoma**.",
    "15‑month‑old with rapid eye movements (opsoclonus), myoclonic jerks, and an abdominal tumor → **Neuroblastoma** (opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome).",
    "Child with periorbital ecchymoses (raccoon eyes), bone pain, and an adrenal mass → metastatic **Neuroblastoma**."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Low-risk: **surgery** alone (or observation for small infant tumors) often suffices (excellent prognosis).",
    "Intermediate-risk: **chemotherapy** (few cycles) plus surgical resection (≥90% survival).",
    "High-risk: intensive multimodal therapy – induction **chemotherapy**, then surgical resection, followed by high-dose chemo with **autologous stem-cell transplant**, plus **immunotherapy** (anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies) and differentiation therapy with **retinoic acid**."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Back pain, lower extremity weakness, or bowel/bladder dysfunction in a child with neuroblastoma → suspect **spinal cord compression** (give corticosteroids immediately and urgent neurosurgical evaluation).",
    "Refractory **hypertension** or tachyarrhythmia in a neuroblastoma patient (rare catecholamine surge) may signal a catecholamine crisis – manage with appropriate alpha/beta blockade (as in pheochromocytoma)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Suspected neuroblastoma (infant with abdominal mass) → initial workup: abdominal ultrasound and urine VMA/HVA levels.",
    "If imaging and labs suggest neuroblastoma → obtain tumor **biopsy** for confirmation (small round blue cells on histology; send for N-MYC testing).",
    "After diagnosis → **stage** with cross-sectional imaging (plus mIBG scan for mets) and bilateral bone marrow biopsy.",
    "Risk-stratify (age, stage, biology) and treat: **low-risk** = observe or surgical resection; **high-risk** = multi-agent chemo → surgery → stem-cell transplant + immunotherapy."
