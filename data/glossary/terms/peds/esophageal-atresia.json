  "definition": "Congenital discontinuity of the esophagus (ends in a blind pouch) that prevents swallowed material from reaching the stomach; often accompanied by a tracheoesophageal fistula (abnormal connection to the airway).",
  "why_it_matters": "Life-threatening if not recognized early—newborns cannot feed and risk aspirating saliva/feeds. A classic neonatal surgical emergency and high-yield on boards.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Prenatal: **polyhydramnios** (excess amniotic fluid) due to fetal inability to swallow; ultrasound may show a small or absent stomach bubble.",
    "At birth: excessive drooling and secretions; newborn immediately **coughs, chokes, and turns cyanotic** with first feeding (the classic \"3 C's\").",
    "**Nasogastric (NG) tube fails to pass** into the stomach (meets obstruction ~10-12 cm from gums). **X-ray** reveals the NG tube coiled in a blind upper esophageal pouch.",
    "If a distal TEF is present (most common type), the stomach and intestines fill with air (visible on X-ray); if no fistula, the abdomen remains **gasless** (scaphoid).",
    "Often associated with other anomalies (consider **VACTERL**: Vertebral, imperforate Anus, Cardiac, Tracheo-Esophageal, Renal, Limb anomalies)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "**Do not feed** a baby with suspected EA. Attempt to pass an NG tube; if it cannot reach the stomach, obtain an X-ray to confirm atresia (coiled tube in esophagus).",
    "On X-ray, presence of abdominal gas helps identify the type: **gas in stomach → distal TEF**; **no gas → pure EA** (no fistula).",
    "Stabilize the infant: keep **NPO**, position head upright (to minimize reflux), and use continuous suction to clear the esophageal pouch (prevent aspiration).",
    "Evaluate for other anomalies given the high incidence of VACTERL association (e.g., echocardiogram, renal ultrasound, spinal radiographs).",
    "Consult pediatric surgery for prompt repair. If the esophageal gap is too long for primary anastomosis, a staged approach (gastrostomy for feeding and later surgical repair) may be necessary."

  "differentials": [
    {
      "id": "duodenal-atresia",
      "hint": "Bilious vomiting and abdominal distension soon after feeds; **double-bubble** sign on X-ray; no choking during feeding; associated with Down syndrome."
    },
    {
      "id": "choanal-atresia",
      "hint": "Newborn turns **cyanotic when feeding** (can't breathe through nose) and pink when crying; difficulty passing a nasal catheter; NG tube passes to stomach normally."
    },
    {
      "id": "laryngeal-cleft",
      "hint": "Rare congenital cleft between larynx and esophagus → aspiration and recurrent pneumonia; feeding difficulty **without esophageal obstruction**."
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "**3 C's** of TEF: **Coughing, Choking, Cyanosis** with feeds.",
    "**VACTERL** association: think of Vertebral, Anal, Cardiac, Tracheoesophageal, Renal, Limb anomalies accompanying EA/TEF."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Full-term newborn (history of polyhydramnios) with **drooling** and **choking/cyanosis on first feeding**, and an NG tube that cannot be advanced into the stomach → esophageal atresia (likely with TEF).",
    "Chest X-ray showing a **coiled NG tube in the upper esophagus** and **air in the stomach** → esophageal atresia with distal tracheoesophageal fistula (Gross type C, most common).",
    "If X-ray shows a coiled NG tube but **no gas in the abdomen** → pure esophageal atresia without a fistula."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Surgical repair** is definitive: end-to-end esophageal anastomosis and closure of any fistula, typically within the first days of life.",
    "Pre-op management: strict **NPO**, elevate head of bed, continuous suction of the upper pouch to prevent aspiration; provide IV fluids for hydration (and antibiotics if aspiration pneumonia is suspected).",
    "If primary anastomosis is not possible (e.g., long-gap EA), a staged approach (e.g., gastrostomy feeding and later esophageal lengthening procedures) is used in specialized centers.",
    "Post-repair, monitor for complications: esophageal **strictures** (may require dilation), recurrent TEF, or chronic gastroesophageal reflux (common in repaired EA)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Any newborn with **cyanosis or respiratory distress during feeding** → stop feeds immediately and evaluate for EA/TEF (to prevent aspiration and suffocation).",
    "After surgical repair, **persistent drooling or difficulty swallowing** suggests an anastomotic stricture, and **recurrent choking/coughing with feeds** may indicate a recurrent fistula—both warrant prompt evaluation."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Prenatal ultrasound: **polyhydramnios** (± absent stomach bubble) raises suspicion for esophageal atresia.",
    "Newborn with **drooling and choking** on first feed → suspect EA/TEF.",
    "Attempt NG tube placement: if tube **cannot reach stomach**, get X-ray to confirm a coiled tube in the esophagus.",
    "If abdomen is **gasless on X-ray** → isolated esophageal atresia; if **stomach gas is present** → distal TEF likely.",
    "Prevent aspiration (NPO, suction, upright position) and arrange **surgical repair**; concurrently screen for other VACTERL anomalies."
