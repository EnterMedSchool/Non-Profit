  "definition": "X-linked recessive **dystrophin** gene mutation causing absent dystrophin protein and progressive muscle fiber degeneration.",
  "why_it_matters": "Most common fatal **childhood** muscular dystrophy; boys develop early weakness and lose ambulation by adolescence. Complications (cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure) lead to death in early adulthood.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "**Toddler/young boy** with delayed motor milestones (late walking) and **proximal** muscle weakness (trouble climbing, frequent falls).",
    "Waddling gait, **lumbar lordosis**, and **Gowers sign** (using hands to \"climb\" up legs when standing) by age 3–6.",
    "Calf **pseudohypertrophy** (enlarged calves from fat/connective tissue) appears a bit later. Eventual wheelchair dependence by ~age 12."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "If you suspect DMD, check **CK** level – it will be massively elevated (often >10× normal).",
    "Confirm diagnosis with genetic testing for **DMD gene** deletions/variants (e.g., multiplex PCR or MLPA). Muscle biopsy (immunostaining or Western blot) shows **absent dystrophin** if genetic testing is inconclusive.",
    "Assess cardiac and respiratory status at baseline (echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests), and offer genetic counseling (mother & female relatives may be carriers)."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "name": "Becker muscular dystrophy",
      "hint": "later onset (teens or adulthood), **partial** dystrophin (in-frame mutations) → milder course"
    },
    {
      "name": "Spinal muscular atrophy",
      "hint": "infantile or childhood onset, proximal weakness from **anterior horn** cell degeneration (LMN signs, fasciculations); normal dystrophin gene"
    },
    {
      "name": "Cerebral palsy",
      "hint": "non-progressive, early motor delay due to brain injury (often spasticity & hyperreflexia, normal CK)"
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: **Duchenne = Deleted Dystrophin** (frameshift or nonsense mutation → no protein); **Becker = Bad but not absent** (some protein, hence milder).",
    "**Gowers sign** tip: child uses arms to climb up their body due to weak legs.",
    "DMD gene is the **largest** human gene (~2.2 Mb) → high mutation rate (≈1/3 cases from new mutations).",
    "Avoid **succinylcholine** in DMD patients (risk of life-threatening rhabdo or malignant hyperthermia-like reaction under anesthesia)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "A 4‑year‑old boy with delayed walking, frequent falls, and using his hands to push on his legs to stand (positive Gowers sign); exam shows calf enlargement → **Duchenne muscular dystrophy**.",
    "Teen male with history of Duchenne MD now presents with chest pain and dyspnea; EKG shows arrhythmia, echo shows dilated cardiomyopathy → **DMD-associated cardiomyopathy** (common in late-stage DMD)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Glucocorticoids** (e.g., prednisone or deflazacort) are the mainstay – they slow muscle degeneration and prolong ambulation.",
    "**Exon skipping** therapies (e.g., antisense oligonucleotides like eteplirsen) can allow production of partial dystrophin for certain mutations.",
    "Supportive care: **Physical therapy** and bracing to improve mobility and prevent contractures; **pulmonary support** (e.g., nighttime ventilation) as respiratory muscles weaken; **cardiac management** (ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers) to delay heart failure.",
    "New prospects: experimental **gene therapies** (micro-dystrophin viral vectors) are under investigation."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Signs of **nighttime hypoventilation** (morning headaches, daytime sleepiness) in a DMD patient → initiate noninvasive ventilation (BiPAP) to prevent respiratory failure.",
    "**Acute heart failure** or arrhythmia in a DMD patient → evaluate and treat for dilated cardiomyopathy (a common late complication)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Young boy with motor delay or proximal weakness → check **serum CK** (markedly elevated in DMD).",
    "If CK is high → perform **genetic test** for DMD gene mutation to confirm Duchenne MD.",
    "Consider **muscle biopsy** if genetic testing is negative or unavailable (dystrophin immunostaining).",
    "After diagnosis: start **steroids** if appropriate, monitor heart (echos) & lungs (PFTs) regularly, and provide family **genetic counseling**."
