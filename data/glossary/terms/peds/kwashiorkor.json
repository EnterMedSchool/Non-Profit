  "definition": "Severe protein malnutrition in children characterized by **bilateral pitting edema** and fatty liver (distended abdomen).",
  "why_it_matters": "Life-threatening if untreated (undernutrition underlies ~45% of under-5 child deaths) and a classic exam example of severe malnutrition (often contrasted with **marasmus**).",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Typically in a child ~1–3 years old, **post-weaning** (e.g., older sibling displaced from breastfeeding when a new baby arrives) with a diet high in starch but extremely low in protein. Common in extreme poverty or famine, often precipitated by an infection (e.g., measles, chronic diarrhea) that worsens nutrition.",
    "Hallmark **edema**: **bilateral pitting edema** in legs/feet (can progress to generalized anasarca) with a **swollen abdomen** (hepatomegaly from fatty liver). Children may appear plump or of normal weight due to fluid retention, masking severe muscle wasting.",
    "Skin and hair changes: patchy **hyperpigmented** rash with **desquamation** (peeling, 'flaky paint' skin); hair becomes **thin, brittle, and reddish** or depigmented (may show a 'flag sign' banding).",
    "Behavior: malnourished children are often **irritable, apathetic**, and have poor appetite (**anorexia**) (unlike marasmus, where appetite is usually preserved)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Assess nutritional status: measure **MUAC** and weight-for-height. **MUAC < 11.5 cm** or weight-for-height < –3 SD = **severe acute malnutrition**. **Bilateral pitting edema** (of nutritional origin) also defines SAM (kwashiorkor) even if weight is normal.",
    "Rule out other edema causes: e.g., check urine for protein to exclude **nephrotic syndrome**. In kwashiorkor, edema occurs without another cause and in context of obvious malnutrition (hair/skin changes, etc.).",
    "Decide inpatient vs outpatient: **Any edema, poor appetite, or acute complication** (infection, shock, etc.) = **complicated SAM** → admit for inpatient care. If child is alert, with good appetite and no edema or complications = **uncomplicated SAM** → manage with outpatient therapeutic feeding.",
    "Differentiate kwashiorkor vs **marasmus**: both are severe **PEM**, but **marasmus** is severe wasting without edema (a frail, emaciated child). Management principles overlap (careful refeeding, infection treatment), though kwashiorkor tends to have more urgent complications (edema, hypoglycemia, etc.)."

  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Stabilization first: treat **hypoglycemia** (immediate feeding or IV 10% dextrose) and **hypothermia** (keep warm) as they often coexist with infection. Start broad **antibiotics** empirically (assuming hidden infection).",
    "Rehydrate **carefully**: malnourished children have reduced cardiac reserve. Use oral rehydration slowly (low-sodium **ReSoMal** solution); avoid IV fluids unless in shock (risk of fluid overload).",
    "Provide **micronutrients**: give **vitamin A** on admission (especially if measles or eye signs of deficiency) and daily multivitamins. Correct electrolyte deficiencies (low potassium, magnesium, etc.). **Do not give iron** in the initial stabilization phase; add iron later during recovery once appetite improves.",
    "Begin cautious feeding with **WHO F-75** therapeutic milk (low-calorie, low-protein starter formula) in small, frequent feeds. After 2–7 days (when appetite returns and edema improves), transition to **F-100** or ready-to-use therapeutic food (**RUTF**) for catch-up growth. Monitor closely for **refeeding syndrome** or fluid overload during this transition."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Lethargy, unconsciousness, or body temp < 35.5 °C** in a malnourished child → possible hypoglycemia or sepsis; requires immediate glucose, warming, and urgent care.",
    "**No appetite** despite severe malnutrition → indicates **complicated SAM** (often with infection); child needs inpatient care.",
    "Worsening edema or difficulty breathing during feeding → suspect **refeeding syndrome** or incipient heart failure (slow down feeds, correct electrolytes)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Child with signs of malnutrition (wasting or edema) → measure weight/height and MUAC.",
    "If **WFH < –3 SD**, **MUAC < 11.5 cm**, or bilateral **pitting edema** present → diagnose **severe acute malnutrition (SAM)**.",
    "Check for complications: assess for hypoglycemia, hypothermia, infection, dehydration, anemia, etc., and do an appetite test.",
    "Classify: **complicated SAM** (edema, complications or poor appetite) → treat inpatient (WHO 10-step protocol). **Uncomplicated SAM** (no edema, appetite okay) → treat outpatient with therapeutic feeds.",
    "In inpatient management: follow WHO steps (e.g., treat hypoglycemia/hypothermia, cautious rehydration, antibiotics, gentle feeding with F-75, then F-100) and monitor closely. In outpatient: provide high-energy RUTF and follow-up weekly until recovery."
