    "Only applies to **metabolic acidosis** - different formulas for alkalosis",
    "In severe acidosis (HCO₃ <8), maximum respiratory compensation may be reached (~10-12 mmHg)",
    "Remember: Compensation never **overcorrects** - if pH is normal with abnormal HCO₃ and PCO₂, it's a mixed disorder"
