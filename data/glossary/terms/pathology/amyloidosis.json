  "definition": "Pathologic **extracellular deposition** of insoluble misfolded protein fibrils (β-pleated sheets) in tissues, leading to progressive organ dysfunction.",
  "why_it_matters": "Multi-organ, potentially fatal disease; hallmark **Congo red** stain (apple-green birefringence) and the need to identify the amyloid **type** (AL vs AA vs ATTR) make it a frequently tested diagnosis.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Standardized nomenclature convention: **A X** (A = amyloidosis; X = fibril protein). Examples: **AL** (amyloid light chain), **AA** (amyloid A protein), **ATTR** (amyloid transthyretin).",
    "AL (primary) amyloidosis: monoclonal **immunoglobulin light chains** (from a plasma cell dyscrasia like multiple myeloma) deposit as AL amyloid. Typically causes **nephrotic syndrome**, **restrictive cardiomyopathy**, peripheral neuropathy; classic features include **macroglossia** and **periorbital purpura**.",
    "AA (secondary) amyloidosis: chronic **inflammation/infection** (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, TB) → high serum amyloid A → AA amyloid deposits. Classically presents with renal involvement (e.g., **nephrotic syndrome**); may also cause hepatosplenomegaly.",
    "ATTR (wild-type, senile) amyloidosis: deposition of normal **transthyretin** (TTR) in older adults (median age ~75; ~90% men). Predominantly **cardiac** involvement (restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias) and often **carpal tunnel** syndrome; progression is slower than AL amyloidosis.",
    "ATTR (hereditary) amyloidosis: autosomal dominant **mutations** in transthyretin. Presents as **familial amyloid polyneuropathy** (peripheral/autonomic neuropathy, onset in 20–40s) or **familial amyloid cardiomyopathy** (heart failure in middle-age or later).",
    "Aβ₂M (dialysis-related) amyloidosis: **β₂-microglobulin** accumulates in patients with end-stage renal disease on long-term dialysis. Deposits in **joints** and **tendons** (e.g., shoulder pain, **carpal tunnel syndrome**, bone cysts), typically after >10 years on dialysis."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Confirm amyloid: biopsy (abdominal fat pad aspirate or involved organ) with **Congo red** staining (shows apple-green birefringence). Then perform **fibril typing** via immunohistochemistry or mass spectrometry to determine the amyloid protein.",
    "Identify underlying cause: if **AL** suspected, check for monoclonal proteins (**SPEP/UPEP, serum free light chains**) and do bone marrow biopsy for plasma cell dyscrasia; if **AA**, search for chronic infection/inflammation (e.g., culture, inflammatory markers); if **ATTR**, consider genetic testing for transthyretin mutations.",
    "Cardiac evaluation: if heart involvement is suspected, obtain ECG (classically **low voltage** with amyloid cardiomyopathy) and echocardiogram. A nuclear **99m Tc-PYP** scan can noninvasively detect ATTR cardiac amyloid and help distinguish it from AL."

    {
      "id": "hemochromatosis",

  "tricks": [
    "Think **Congo red** → **apple-green birefringence** under polarized light: classic pathologic finding for amyloid deposits.",
    "Clues for **AL amyloidosis**: **macroglossia** or **periorbital purpura** (raccoon eyes) are highly specific and rarely seen in other types.",
    "Amyloid cardiomyopathy often shows **low-voltage ECG** despite thickened ventricular walls (due to insulating amyloid in myocardium)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Older adult with unexplained **restrictive cardiomyopathy** (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), heavy **proteinuria** (nephrotic-range), and enlarged tongue on exam → AL (primary) amyloidosis (confirm with Congo red stain).",
    "Patient with long-standing **rheumatoid arthritis** who develops nephrotic syndrome and hepatomegaly → AA (reactive) amyloidosis from chronic inflammation.",
    "Elderly man (~75) with congestive heart failure symptoms and history of bilateral **carpal tunnel syndrome** → senile **ATTR** amyloidosis (wild-type transthyretin deposits in heart/tendons)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Treat the **underlying cause** of the amyloid protein when possible (specialist-guided by type).",
    "**AL amyloidosis**: systemic chemotherapy (e.g., **melphalan** plus corticosteroids, or newer regimens like bortezomib-based therapy) ± autologous **stem cell transplant** for eligible patients.",
    "**AA amyloidosis**: aggressive management of the chronic inflammatory disease (e.g., immunosuppressants for rheumatoid arthritis, **colchicine** for familial Mediterranean fever) to reduce serum amyloid A production.",
    "**ATTR amyloidosis**: newer disease-modifying agents (e.g., **tafamidis** to stabilize transthyretin) or, for hereditary cases, **liver transplant** to remove the source of mutant TTR. Advanced cardiac amyloidosis may require **heart transplant**; provide supportive care for heart failure and other complications."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Suspected **AL amyloidosis** with cardiac involvement is a medical emergency – without prompt therapy, median survival can be under 1 year. Rapidly worsening heart failure or arrhythmias in AL amyloid warrants urgent specialist intervention.",
    "Amyloidosis can lead to **sudden cardiac death** (due to arrhythmias/conduction block) or irreversible **renal failure**. Monitor cardiac rhythm and renal function closely; consider defibrillator placement for high-risk cardiac amyloid patients and timely dialysis/transplant referral for progressing renal impairment."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Unexplained multi-organ dysfunction (e.g., cardiomyopathy + nephrotic syndrome + neuropathy) → **suspect amyloidosis**.",
    "Initial evaluation: screen for monoclonal proteins (**SPEP/UPEP, light chains**) and inflammatory markers; perform relevant imaging (e.g., echo, MRI, PYP scan if ATTR suspected).",
    "Obtain a tissue **biopsy** (fat pad or involved organ) → if Congo red positive (amyloid), proceed to amyloid **typing** (via IHC or mass spec) to determine AL vs AA vs ATTR.",
    "Direct treatment according to type: plasma cell–directed therapy for AL, treat underlying disease for AA, or specific measures (tafamidis, transplant) for ATTR; provide supportive care for organ dysfunction."
