  "definition": "Elevated blood **lactate** (usually >4 mmol/L) causing an **anion gap** metabolic acidosis (arterial pH <7.35 with low bicarbonate).",
  "why_it_matters": "Signals severe illness—it's the **most common** metabolic acidosis in ICU patients. High lactate reflects tissue hypoperfusion and correlates with worse outcomes (the higher/longer the elevation, the higher the mortality risk). Frequently appears on exams as a marker of **shock** or drug toxicity.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Critically ill patients in **shock** (septic, cardiogenic, etc.) often have lactic acidosis due to poor perfusion. Clues include hypotension, tachycardia, and signs of hypoperfusion (cool clammy skin, delayed capillary refill) in Type A lactic acidosis.",
    "Can also occur **without** obvious hypoxia: Type B lactic acidosis in contexts like severe liver/renal failure, **metformin** use (especially in CKD), malignancy, or post-**seizure** exertion (transient). These involve lactate overproduction or decreased clearance despite adequate perfusion.",
    "**Lab:** High serum lactate (e.g., >4 mmol/L is significant) with an **anion gap** metabolic acidosis on ABG/CMP (low HCO₃⁻, low pH). Mild elevations (2–4 mmol/L) without acidosis are called **hyperlactatemia**."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "**Confirm** lactic acidosis: measure serum lactate in any high anion gap metabolic acidosis or shocked patient. Calculate the anion gap (correct for low albumin) and obtain an **ABG** to assess pH severity.",
    "**Find the cause (Type A vs B):** If signs of hypoperfusion (hypotension, hypoxia) → **Type A** (tissue hypoxia); address immediately (fluids, oxygen, treat shock). If perfusion is intact → **Type B**; look for other causes (toxins, organ failure, **thiamine** deficiency, etc.).",
    "**Consider contributing factors:** For example, give **thiamine** if deficiency is possible (alcoholics), review medications (metformin, beta-agonists, HIV NRTIs, etc.), and evaluate liver/kidney function (impaired lactate clearance)."

  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: **MUDPILES** for high anion gap acidosis causes (Methanol, Uremia, DKA, Propylene glycol, INH/Iron, **Lactic acidosis**, Ethylene glycol, Salicylates).",
    "In septic shock, lactate **clearance** (lactate dropping with treatment) is a good sign; persistently high lactate indicates poor prognosis.",
    "**Thiamine** (vitamin B1) is needed to metabolize pyruvate; deficiency (e.g., in alcoholics) can lead to lactic buildup – always replete B1 when suspecting malnutrition."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "**Septic shock** – A febrile, hypotensive patient with high lactate (~6 mmol/L) and anion gap metabolic acidosis despite fluids → Type A lactic acidosis from inadequate tissue perfusion (lactate as a marker of severe sepsis).",
    "**Metformin** overdose – A type 2 diabetic on metformin (with CKD) presents with confusion and deep rapid breathing; labs show pH ~7.1, anion gap 24, lactate very high → **Metformin-associated lactic acidosis** (Type B; biguanide accumulation impairs lactate clearance)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Restore perfusion:** In shock, give aggressive IV fluids, improve oxygenation, and use vasopressors if needed to improve tissue perfusion. Treat the underlying cause (e.g., antibiotics for sepsis, revascularization for ischemia).",
    "**Remove offending causes:** Stop any causative drugs or toxins (e.g., metformin); administer antidotes if applicable (100% O₂ for CO poisoning, antidote for cyanide, thiamine for B1 deficiency, etc.).",
    "**Bicarbonate:** Reserved for severe acidosis (pH < ~6.9). IV sodium bicarbonate can temporize extreme acidemia, but avoid overuse (may cause CO₂ buildup and paradoxical CNS acidosis). Focus on definitive treatment of the cause.",
    "**Dialysis:** In refractory or toxin-induced cases, consider renal replacement therapy to help clear lactate and correct acidosis (e.g., in metformin toxicity or profound shock with AKI)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Lactate ≥4 mmol/L** with hypotension – sign of critical illness (e.g., septic shock). High lactate plus shock = high mortality risk → requires ICU-level aggressive management.",
    "Arterial **pH <7.1** (with high lactate) – severe acidosis can depress cardiac contractility and catecholamine response. Watch for arrhythmias and cardiovascular collapse; consider emergent dialysis or bicarbonate."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Suspect lactic acidosis in any ill patient with high anion gap metabolic acidosis or signs of poor perfusion.",
    "Measure serum **lactate** and get an ABG to confirm acidosis (lactate >2 mmol/L, especially >4, with pH <7.35).",
    "If lactate is elevated, assess perfusion/oxygenation: hypotension or hypoxia suggests **Type A** (hypoperfusion); if perfusion is normal, think **Type B** causes.",
    "Treat the underlying cause promptly: e.g., broad-spectrum **antibiotics** + fluids for sepsis, restore circulation for ischemia, stop offending drugs (metformin, etc.), give **thiamine** if needed, etc.",
    "Monitor lactate trends as you resuscitate. If lactate remains high or patient deteriorates, escalate care (ICU, consider vasopressors, mechanical support, or dialysis as needed)."
