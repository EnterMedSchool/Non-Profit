  "definition": "Progressive loss of kidney function over ≥3 months, defined by **eGFR** <60 mL/min/1.73 m² or signs of kidney damage (e.g., persistent **albuminuria**).",
  "why_it_matters": "Very common (≈14% of adults) and a leading cause of **end-stage renal disease** requiring dialysis or transplant. Causes systemic issues (anemia, bone disease, acidosis, CV risk) and frequently appears on exams linking kidney function to widespread effects.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Often **asymptomatic** until late stages; early clues are subtle (nocturia, fatigue). Advanced CKD causes **uremic** symptoms (anorexia, pruritus, confusion), plus **edema**, **hypertension**, and **anemia** (due to low EPO).",
    "Adult causes: **diabetes** (diabetic nephropathy) and **hypertension** are most common; also chronic glomerular diseases (e.g., IgA nephropathy), **polycystic kidney disease**, or long-standing obstruction (stones, BPH).",
    "Pediatric causes: usually **CAKUT** (congenital anomalies of kidney & urinary tract like reflux or posterior urethral valves), **reflux nephropathy** from recurrent UTIs, hereditary nephropathies (e.g., **nephronophthisis**), or chronic glomerulopathies."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Confirm chronicity: check old creatinine trends and kidney size (small, shrunken kidneys suggest chronic disease).",
    "Stage the CKD: GFR categories 1–5 (stage 3 starts at **GFR <60**, stage 5 is **<15** or dialysis) and classify **albuminuria** (A1 <30, A2 30–300, A3 >300 mg/g).",
    "Evaluate cause: get **urinalysis** (protein, hematuria, casts) and **urine ACR** (albumin-creatinine ratio) to quantify proteinuria; consider serologies for glomerulonephritis if indicated.",
    "Imaging: perform renal **ultrasound** to assess size and rule out obstruction or structural abnormalities (CKD kidneys often appear small and scarred, except in diabetes or PKD which may be enlarged).",
    "Monitor for complications: regularly check **hemoglobin** (for anemia of CKD), **electrolytes** (especially potassium), **bicarbonate** (metabolic acidosis), and **calcium/phosphate/PTH** (secondary hyperparathyroidism)."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "name": "Prerenal azotemia",
      "hint": "reversible ↓GFR from low perfusion (e.g., dehydration, heart failure)"
    },
    {
      "name": "Acute glomerulonephritis",
      "hint": "active urinary sediment (RBC casts), shorter duration, often nephritic syndrome"
    },
    {
      "name": "Postrenal (obstructive) AKI",
      "hint": "acute decline due to obstruction (hydronephrosis on imaging, resolves if blockage relieved)"
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Fewer nephrons → surviving nephrons **hyperfilter** to compensate, which over time causes fibrosis (hyperfiltration injury accelerates CKD).",
    "CKD usually leads to **small kidneys** on imaging due to scarring (exceptions: diabetic nephropathy and **PKD** can have normal or large kidneys).",
    "ACE inhibitors/ARBs slow progression by reducing hyperfiltration pressure (dilate efferent arteriole)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Long-standing diabetic patient with proteinuria, progressively ↑creatinine, and small echogenic kidneys on ultrasound → diabetic CKD (nephropathy).",
    "Child with history of recurrent UTIs, growth failure, anemia, and bilateral renal scarring on imaging → CKD from reflux nephropathy.",
    "CKD patient with pericardial friction rub and confusion → **uremic** pericarditis/encephalopathy (indication for urgent dialysis)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Slow the progression: strict **BP control** (<130/80) with ACEi/ARB (especially if proteinuria); optimize glycemic control in diabetics; avoid nephrotoxins (NSAIDs, IV contrast).",
    "Manage complications: **erythropoietin-stimulating agents** for anemia, **phosphate binders** and calcitriol for renal bone disease, **bicarbonate** supplements for metabolic acidosis, diuretics and salt restriction for volume overload, etc.",
    "Plan for renal replacement: when GFR falls <20–30 (stage 4), educate and prepare for **dialysis** (vascular access for hemodialysis) or **transplant** evaluation; start dialysis for uremic symptoms or severe electrolyte imbalances."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Signs of **uremia** (encephalopathy, pericarditis, asterixis, bleeding) or refractory **hyperkalemia**/fluid overload → urgent dialysis is indicated.",
    "Sudden GFR decline in CKD patient—think **acute on chronic** (e.g., volume depletion, nephrotoxic drug, obstruction) which may be reversible if addressed promptly."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Risk factors (diabetes, HTN) or elevated creatinine >3 months → suspect CKD.",
    "Confirm CKD if **eGFR <60** for ≥3 months or markers of damage (proteinuria, structural lesions).",
    "Exclude acute causes: review meds, ensure volume status, rule out obstruction (bladder scan, ultrasound).",
    "Classify stage by eGFR and albuminuria; address reversible factors and co-morbidities (control BP, glucose, stop nephrotoxins).",
    "Refer to nephrology by late Stage 3–4; if GFR <30, plan for renal replacement (access placement, transplant referral)."
