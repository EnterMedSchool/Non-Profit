  "definition": "Genetic disorders characterized by numerous fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. Autosomal **dominant** PKD (ADPKD) is common (≈1:500) and usually presents in adulthood (mutations in **PKD1** or **PKD2**); Autosomal **recessive** PKD (ARPKD) is rare (≈1:20,000) and presents in infancy (mutation in **PKHD1**).",
  "why_it_matters": "ADPKD is a significant cause of **end-stage renal disease** (responsible for ~10% of dialysis patients) and has systemic implications (**liver cysts**, **aneurysms**). It often appears in exams highlighting **dominant inheritance** or kidney cysts with **berry aneurysm**. ARPKD, while rare, is high-yield for its often fatal neonatal presentation and lifelong complications in survivors (kidney and liver failure).",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "**ADPKD (adult form):** Young adult with early-onset **hypertension**, flank pain, and recurrent **hematuria** or UTIs. Often has a family history of kidney disease. Kidneys are enlarged (sometimes palpable); extrarenal findings include **liver cysts** and **cerebral aneurysms**.",
    "**ARPKD (infantile form):** Newborn or infant with massively enlarged **echogenic kidneys**, respiratory distress from pulmonary hypoplasia (**Potter sequence**), and signs of **congenital hepatic fibrosis** (portal hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly). If milder, presents in childhood with growth failure and hypertension."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect PKD in patients with family history of kidney cysts or unexplained **hypertension** with enlarged kidneys.",
    "Confirm diagnosis with **renal ultrasound** (first-line): multiple bilateral cysts on imaging (criteria vary by age). Use **CT/MRI** if ultrasound is equivocal or to assess total kidney volume.",
    "Consider **genetic testing** for PKD1/PKD2 (ADPKD) or PKHD1 (ARPKD) especially if ultrasound is inconclusive or for early screening in at-risk individuals.",
    "Evaluate kidney function (baseline **creatinine**, eGFR) and monitor over time. Control blood pressure (helps slow cyst progression) and avoid nephrotoxic drugs.",
    "Screen for complications: e.g., **intracranial aneurysm** (MRA) if family history of aneurysm or high-risk factors; monitor for **UTIs** (which may indicate infected cyst) and treat promptly."

  "differentials": [
    {
      "name": "Simple renal cysts",
      "hint": "few in number, common in older adults; incidental findings without kidney enlargement"

  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: '**polycystic kidney**' has 16 letters → **PKD1** on chromosome 16; **PKD2** is on chromosome 4.",
    "Autosomal **D**ominant (ADPKD) = **A**dult onset; Autosomal **R**ecessive (ARPKD) = **R**apid (infant) onset.",
    "ADPKD's extrarenal features: cysts in **liver** (common), **pancreas**, **spleen**, and risk of **berry aneurysms** in the brain."

    "30‑year‑old with hypertension, recurrent hematuria, bilateral flank masses, and a family history of kidney failure → **Autosomal dominant PKD** (ADPKD).",
    "Newborn with large, bilateral flank masses, pulmonary insufficiency at birth (oligohydramnios), and later portal hypertension → **Autosomal recessive PKD** (ARPKD)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Aggressive **blood pressure control** (target <130/80 with ACE inhibitor) to slow cyst growth; encourage high fluid intake (to suppress ADH).",
    "For rapidly progressing ADPKD, consider **tolvaptan** (vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist) to slow cyst development (monitor liver enzymes while on therapy).",
    "Manage complications: prompt antibiotics for cyst infections (**fluoroquinolones** penetrate cysts), pain management (avoid NSAIDs; consider cyst aspiration or surgical decompression if needed), and hydration to prevent kidney stones.",
    "Plan for renal replacement in advanced disease: **dialysis** when kidneys fail and ultimately **kidney transplant** (transplant is definitive; combined liver-kidney transplant if severe hepatic fibrosis)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Sudden, severe headache in an ADPKD patient → evaluate for ruptured **berry aneurysm** (subarachnoid hemorrhage emergency).",
    "In ARPKD, **neonatal respiratory distress** from massive kidneys → may require immediate ventilation support and even neonatal nephrectomy to relieve lung compression."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Family history of PKD or multiple kidney cysts on imaging → suspect PKD.",
    "Perform **kidney ultrasound**: if age-based cyst criteria are met, confirm the diagnosis.",
    "If ultrasound is negative but suspicion remains (e.g., young patient with affected parent), do **genetic testing** or follow up later (cysts develop with age in ADPKD).",
    "Differentiate subtype: ADPKD (autosomal dominant) usually in adults with affected parent; ARPKD (autosomal recessive) in infants/children with unaffected parents.",
    "Once diagnosed, manage with blood pressure control and monitoring. Screen for complications (aneurysm, infection) and prepare for **dialysis/transplant** as disease progresses."

      "teaching": "ADPKD causes progressive bilateral renal cyst formation leading to enlarged kidneys, hypertension, hematuria, and flank pain. It follows an autosomal dominant pattern (50% chance to pass to offspring). Patients often develop kidney failure in mid-adulthood and can have extrarenal complications like liver cysts or cerebral aneurysms."
