  "definition": "A group of **autosomal dominant** tubulointerstitial nephropathies characterized by slowly progressive chronic kidney disease with a **bland urinary sediment** (little blood/protein), normal-to-small kidneys (± few late **medullary/corticomedullary cysts**), and histology showing **tubular atrophy** and **interstitial fibrosis**. Modern nomenclature groups these conditions as **ADTKD**, subclassified by gene (most often **UMOD**, **MUC1**, **REN**, **HNF1B**; rarer **SEC61A1**, **DNAJB11**, **APOA4**). “Medullary cystic kidney disease (MCKD)” (types 1 & 2) corresponds largely to **ADTKD‑MUC1** and **ADTKD‑UMOD**, and is a misnomer because cysts are not required for diagnosis.",
  "why_it_matters": "Often mislabeled as “CKD of unknown cause,” ADTKD leads to **ESRD in mid‑to‑late adulthood** (median ~40s–50s depending on subtype) and is under‑recognized on exams and in clinic. Early recognition guides **family screening**, avoids unnecessary workups/biopsies, explains **early gout** (UMOD/REN), and prompts appropriate counseling (excellent **transplant** outcomes; disease usually **does not recur** in the graft).",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "**Common thread:** autosomal‑dominant family history of CKD across generations, **minimal proteinuria**, bland urine, slowly rising creatinine beginning in the teens–30s.",
    "**ADTKD‑UMOD (formerly MCKD2/FJHN):** **hyperuricemia with early gout** (often teens/20s), impaired urinary concentration (polyuria/nocturia), normal‑to‑small kidneys with few cysts; CKD progression over decades.",
    "**ADTKD‑MUC1 (formerly MCKD1):** isolated kidney disease—**no consistent extrarenal features**; bland urine, CKD beginning in late teens/20s; cysts may be absent or few; many standard sequencing panels **miss MUC1** (specialized testing needed).",
    "**ADTKD‑REN:** childhood presentation with **hypotension, anemia, mild hyperkalemia & metabolic acidosis**, salt craving/polyuria; later hyperuricemia ± gout; AD family history.",
    "**ADTKD‑HNF1B (RCAD):** kidney disease with **renal cysts/dysplasia** plus **MODY5 diabetes**, **hypomagnesemia**, and GU/pancreatic/hepatic anomalies; variable course."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "**When to suspect ADTKD:** AD family history of CKD + **bland urine** (protein <~500 mg/day) + normal/small kidneys (± few medullary/corticomedullary cysts).",
    "**First steps:** urinalysis (often bland), serum **uric acid** (high in UMOD/REN), renal ultrasound (often normal early; later small kidneys ± few cysts).",
    "**Genetic testing:** order an inherited kidney disease panel **including UMOD, MUC1, REN, HNF1B**. Note: **MUC1 frameshift** variants are hard to detect with routine NGS/Sanger; targeted assays or immunostaining for **MUC1fs** may be required at specialized labs.",
    "**Biopsy?** Not diagnostic alone (nonspecific **tubulointerstitial fibrosis/TA, thickened/lamellated TBM; microcysts**). Use it mainly to exclude other etiologies.",
    "**Subtype clues:** early gout → **UMOD/REN**; childhood anemia/hyperkalemia/hypotension → **REN**; extrarenal features (MODY5, GU malformations, low Mg) → **HNF1B**; isolated CKD with negative routine panels → **MUC1**."
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "MCKD is a **misnomer**—you can have ADTKD without visible cysts; kidneys are often **normal or small**, not massively cystic (contrast with **ADPKD**).",
    "**UMOD = uric acid & gout** (think “U‑ric acid”). **REN = REnin** pathway → childhood **anemia, hyperkalemia, hypotension**. **MUC1 = MUC‑h else normal** (isolated kidney disease).",
    "Urine is **boringly bland** (little protein/hematuria) despite worsening CKD—this is a classic exam clue.",
    "Transplant works well—**disease typically does not recur** in the graft."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Teen with recurrent **gout** and a father/uncle on dialysis; UA with **trace/no protein**, ultrasound shows **small kidneys** with few or no cysts → **ADTKD‑UMOD**.",
    "Child with **fatigue, anemia, mild hyperkalemia, low‑normal BP**, polyuria; parent with CKD in 30s–40s → **ADTKD‑REN**.",
    "Adult with CKD stage 3, **bland urine**, normal‑size kidneys (no significant cyst burden), negative UMOD/HNF1B/REN on panel; specialized testing confirms **MUC1 frameshift** → **ADTKD‑MUC1**.",
    "Don’t confuse with **ADPKD**: huge cystic kidneys, numerous cysts, higher proteinuria; or **medullary sponge kidney**: nephrocalcinosis, stones, often normal kidney function."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "No disease‑modifying therapy yet—**CKD care** (BP control, RAAS blockade as tolerated, avoid nephrotoxins, treat acidosis, manage anemia/mineral bone disease).",
    "**Gout/hyperuricemia (UMOD/REN/HNF1B):** **allopurinol or febuxostat** for flares/prevention; discuss risks (hypersensitivity; pregnancy considerations). Avoid meds that raise urate (e.g., high‑dose thiazides) when possible.",
    "**ADTKD‑REN:** consider **fludrocortisone** and liberal salt intake to address **hypotension/hyperkalemia**; treat childhood **anemia** per CKD practice (± EPO).",
    "**HNF1B (RCAD):** manage **MODY5 diabetes**, monitor/treat **hypomagnesemia** and other extrarenal issues.",
    "**Transplantation:** excellent outcomes; **recurrence in the allograft is not expected** for UMOD/MUC1/REN subtypes."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Early‑onset gout** (teens/20s) with a family history of CKD → think **ADTKD‑UMOD**.",
    "Child with **CKD + anemia + mild hyperkalemia + low BP** in a dominant pedigree → concerning for **ADTKD‑REN**.",
    "“CKD of unknown cause” with **bland urine** and **normal/small kidneys** across generations—do not miss ADTKD; refer for **genetic testing**."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Suspect inherited tubulointerstitial disease → confirm **AD family history** and **bland urine** (low protein/hematuria).",
    "Renal ultrasound → **normal/small** kidneys ± few medullary/corticomedullary cysts.",
    "Order genetic testing panel (**UMOD, MUC1, REN, HNF1B**; add **SEC61A1/DNAJB11** if available). If panel negative but suspicion high → arrange **MUC1‑specific** testing.",
    "Subtyping guides anticipatory care: **UMOD/REN** (urate/gout), **REN** (child anemia/hypotension/hyperkalemia), **HNF1B** (RCAD features).",
