  "definition": "A decrease in intravascular extracellular fluid volume (esp. plasma volume) due to loss of salt and water (e.g., hemorrhage, GI/renal losses) or maldistribution/third spacing (burns, pancreatitis, sepsis). Not the same as dehydration, which is a pure water deficit causing hypernatremia and intracellular water loss. In practice, both can coexist.",
  "why_it_matters": "Hypovolemia is a leading cause of shock, prerenal azotemia/AKI, and perioperative/trauma morbidity. Early recognition and targeted resuscitation (right fluid, right amount, right timing) are life‑saving and heavily tested across exams and OSCEs.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Common causes: hemorrhage (trauma, GI bleed, postpartum), GI loss (vomiting/diarrhea), renal loss (diuretics, osmotic diuresis), burns, pancreatitis or bowel obstruction (third spacing), sepsis (capillary leak), endocrine salt loss (adrenal insufficiency).",
    "Early signs (compensated): thirst, anxiety, tachycardia, cool clammy skin, delayed capillary refill, flat neck veins/low JVP, oliguria; BP may be normal (narrow pulse pressure).",
    "Late signs (decompensated): hypotension, altered mental status, anuria, lactic acidosis, mottled skin.",
    "Orthostatics: ↓SBP ≥20 mmHg or ↓DBP ≥10 mmHg within 3 min standing suggests volume depletion if clinically appropriate.",
    "Pediatrics: hypotension is late; look for tachycardia, prolonged capillary refill, sunken eyes/fontanelle, absent tears, lethargy.",
    "Hemorrhagic shock classes (ATLS): I (<15%), II (15–30%), III (30–40%), IV (>40%) blood loss with progressively worse tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure, mental status change, oliguria, hypotension."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Start with ABCs; place two large‑bore IVs (or IO), give oxygen, put on monitor; obtain point‑of‑care glucose.",
    "History/Exam: focus on losses (bleeding, GI, urine, burns) and third spacing; check JVP, skin, mucosae, capillary refill, peripheral perfusion, mental status, urine output.",
    "Initial labs: CBC (Hgb/Hct), BMP (BUN/Cr), lactate, type & cross if bleeding, VBG/ABG, coagulation panel; consider cortisol if adrenal crisis suspected.",
    "AKI pattern for prerenal volume depletion: BUN/Cr >20:1, FeNa <1% (or FEUrea <35% if on diuretics), urine Na <20 mEq/L, urine osmolality >500—interpret in clinical context.",
    "Dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness: passive leg raise (PLR) with stroke volume/cardiac output monitoring; bedside echo/IVC variation (interpret with caution: ventilation mode, RV function).",
    "Imaging as indicated: FAST exam/CT for trauma; bedside ultrasound for IVC/cardiac function; CXR if pulmonary edema suspected.",
    "Classify the driver: hemorrhagic vs non‑hemorrhagic (dehydration/third spacing/sepsis/endocrine). Treat the cause in parallel with resuscitation."

    "Adults: target urine output ≥0.5 mL/kg/hr (children ≥1 mL/kg/hr) as one bedside marker of adequate perfusion.",

    "In hemorrhage, avoid large crystalloid loads; activate massive transfusion protocol early with plasma:platelets:RBC ≈ 1:1:1 and control bleeding.",
    "Trauma pearl: consider permissive hypotension (e.g., SBP ~80–90 mmHg) until hemostasis if no TBI; in suspected TBI keep SBP ≥100–110 mmHg.",

    "Burns: Adult with ~30% TBSA burns—asks for initial fluid estimate and titration target (urine output ≥0.5 mL/kg/hr). Know that many exams still reference Parkland 4 mL/kg/%TBSA (½ in first 8 h), but new ABA guidance supports ~2 mL/kg/%TBSA with titration to endpoints."

    "Hemorrhage: Immediate bleeding control (direct pressure, tourniquet, hemostasis), early MTP with ~1:1:1 plasma:platelets:RBC; limit crystalloids. Give TXA 1 g IV over 10 min, then 1 g over 8 h within 3 h of injury. Consider permissive hypotension until hemostasis if no TBI.",
    "Transfusion thresholds (non‑bleeding): in hemodynamically stable adults, consider RBC transfusion when Hb <7 g/dL (individualize by comorbidities).",
    "Burns: Estimate fluids (historically Parkland 4 mL/kg/%TBSA; recent ABA suggests ~2 mL/kg/%TBSA to reduce \"fluid creep\"); use LR and titrate to urine output ≥0.5 mL/kg/hr; adjust for inhalation injury/large burns; consider albumin in larger burns per ABA CPG.",
    "Pediatrics: Bolus 20 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid over 5–10 min; repeat to 40–60 mL/kg if needed while reassessing. If hemorrhagic, transition early to blood products (PRBC 10 mL/kg).",
    "If fluid‑refractory shock: start norepinephrine (first‑line in septic shock) and address etiology (antibiotics, source control; endocrine support if adrenal crisis).",
    "Monitoring/targets: mental status, MAP (≥65 mmHg in septic shock), capillary refill, urine output, serial lactate, point‑of‑care ultrasound; stop fluids when no longer fluid responsive or if signs of overload appear."
