  "definition": "X‑linked recessive **HGPRT** enzyme deficiency that blocks purine salvage, causing **hyperuricemia** (↑uric acid) with early-onset **gout**, **neurologic disability**, and compulsive **self‑mutilation**.",
  "why_it_matters": "Classic inborn error linking **metabolism** and **neurology** – a high-yield example of how a single enzyme defect (HGPRT) leads to gout in a child with severe neurobehavioral issues (self-harm). Often tested on exams as a biochemistry-genetics tie-in.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "**Almost exclusively in infant boys** (X-linked): hypotonia and developmental delay in infancy; by toddler age, they exhibit **self-biting** (fingers, lips) and other self-injury (e.g., head banging).",
    "**Neurologic**: dystonia, choreoathetosis, spasticity, and intellectual disability. They usually cannot walk (wheelchair-bound); speech is often impaired.",
    "**Uric acid overproduction**: causes **orange \"sand\"** (sodium urate crystals) in diapers during infancy, early **kidney stones** or hematuria, and pediatric **gouty arthritis** or tophi."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect LNS in a male child with the triad of **hyperuricemia**, **neurologic dysfunction**, and **self-injurious behavior**. Check serum/urine **uric acid** levels (typically very high).",
    "Confirm diagnosis via **HPRT1 gene** mutation testing or an **HGPRT enzyme assay** (near-absence of HGPRT activity <2% is diagnostic).",
    "Differentiate from partial HGPRT deficiency (Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome) which causes hyperuricemia and early gout but **no neurologic symptoms or self-mutilation**.",
    "Screen for complications: renal ultrasound for **uric acid stones** if flank pain or hematuria; evaluate joints for gouty tophi or arthritis."
  ],

  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: **HGPRT** features → **H**yperuricemia, **G**out, **P** (aggressive self-harm), **R** (intellectual disability), **T** (dysTonia).",
    "Remember **orange crystals in diaper** = urate (think Lesch-Nyhan in a baby boy).",
    "A young child with gout or kidney stones (\"juvenile gout\") is a big clue – consider HGPRT deficiency."

    "Toddler boy with developmental delay who bites his fingers and lips, has spastic movements, and signs of **gout** (swollen toe or kidney stone) → Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.",
    "Biochemistry question: absent HGPRT → can't salvage hypoxanthine/guanine → excess uric acid + ↑**de novo purine synthesis** (↑PRPP amidotransferase). Often answer to \"boy with self-mutilation + gout\"."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "No cure – **supportive care** only. For hyperuricemia: **allopurinol** (or febuxostat) to reduce uric acid and prevent gout/stone complications; also low-purine diet and hydration.",
    "**Self-mutilation**: use protective gear (padded restraints, mouth guards) and behavioral interventions; severe cases may need tooth extraction. Medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, baclofen) can be tried for neurologic symptoms.",
    "Manage spasticity/dystonia with therapy and meds for comfort. Provide multidisciplinary support (neurology, rehab, nutrition) to improve quality of life."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Severe self-injury** (deep bites) causing bleeding or infection risk – may require urgent intervention (sedation or tooth removal).",
    "Any **hematuria** or renal colic in LNS → suspect uric acid stones (need prompt management to avoid kidney damage)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Male infant with neurodevelopmental delays + self-harm → suspect Lesch-Nyhan (especially if **orange crystals** in diapers).",
    "Check **uric acid**; if elevated, confirm with HPRT1 genetic test or enzyme assay.",
    "Start **allopurinol** to control uric acid; counsel family on X-linked inheritance.",
    "Ensure safety: protective measures or dental extractions to prevent self-mutilation.",
    "Monitor long-term for kidney stones and gout complications; provide supportive neuro care."
