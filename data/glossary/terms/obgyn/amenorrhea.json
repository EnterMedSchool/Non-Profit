  "definition": "Amenorrhea is absence of menstruation in a woman of reproductive age. Primary amenorrhea is no menarche by age ~15–16 (or ≥3 years after thelarche). Secondary amenorrhea is cessation of established menses for ≥3 months (if regular) or ≥6 months (if irregular).",
  "why_it_matters": "Amenorrhea may signal serious underlying issues and impacts fertility and bone health. Menstrual patterns reflect overall health. Primary amenorrhea suggests genetic or anatomic disorders (e.g., Turner syndrome, Müllerian agenesis). Secondary amenorrhea often indicates endocrine disorders like PCOS, hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction. About 5–7% of women experience secondary amenorrhea each year, so timely evaluation is crucial to address causes (pregnancy, hormone imbalances, stress) and prevent complications like infertility and osteoporosis.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Primary amenorrhea – teen with no period by age ~15 despite normal breast development; consider ovarian (Turner, gonadal dysgenesis) or outflow (Müllerian agenesis, imperforate hymen) causes.",
    "Turner syndrome – 45,X: short, webbed neck, shield chest, streak ovaries; labs show ↑FSH/LH (gonadal failure).",
    "Secondary amenorrhea – woman stops menstruating: rule out pregnancy first (β-hCG). Common causes: PCOS (obese, hirsutism, irregular cycles), functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (stress, low weight), prolactinoma (galactorrhea, headaches).",
    "Asherman's syndrome – amenorrhea after D&C, cyclic cramping pain without bleeding; ultrasound: thin endometrium; diagnosis by hysteroscopy showing adhesions."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Exclude pregnancy (β-hCG) in all cases.",
    "Check TSH and prolactin to identify thyroid or pituitary causes.",
    "Measure FSH and LH: high FSH → ovarian failure; low/normal FSH with amenorrhea → hypothalamic/pituitary cause.",
    "Pelvic ultrasound: assess uterine anatomy (agenesis, outflow obstruction) and ovaries (PCOS morphology, tumors).",
    "Consider karyotype in primary amenorrhea with short stature or suspected ovarian dysgenesis."
