  "definition": "Common endocrine disorder in reproductive-age women defined by **hyperandrogenism**, **ovulatory dysfunction** (oligo/anovulation), and often **polycystic ovaries** (≥2 of 3 for diagnosis).",
  "why_it_matters": "Most frequent cause of **anovulatory infertility** (up to ~10% of women). Associated with obesity, **insulin resistance**, and higher risks of **type 2 diabetes** and **metabolic syndrome**. Chronic anovulation leads to unopposed estrogen, increasing risk of **endometrial hyperplasia** or carcinoma.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Young woman with **irregular menses** (oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea) and signs of **hyperandrogenism** (hirsutism, acne). Many patients are **obese** with **acanthosis nigricans** (insulin resistance), though **lean PCOS** can also occur.",
    "Ultrasound may show **polycystic ovaries** (≥12 small 2–9 mm follicles in a peripheral *string-of-pearls* pattern), but imaging is not required for diagnosis if clinical criteria are met.",
    "Often identified during workup for **infertility** due to anovulation (difficulty conceiving)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Rule out other causes: check **β-hCG** (pregnancy test), **TSH**, **prolactin**, and **17‑hydroxyprogesterone** (nonclassic CAH) in any woman with oligo/amenorrhea. Test for Cushing syndrome or an androgen-secreting tumor if she has rapid-onset or severe virilization.",
    "Labs: PCOS typically shows mildly elevated **total testosterone** (ovarian source) or **DHEA-S** (adrenal source); markedly high levels (>2× normal) suggest a tumor. **LH:FSH ratio** is often >2:1 (reflecting high LH pulse frequency), but this is not a diagnostic criterion. **FSH** is normal (helps exclude primary ovarian failure).",
    "Pelvic **ultrasound**: not always necessary, but if done, look for ≥12 small follicles per ovary with the classic *string of pearls* appearance (or ovarian volume >10 mL). Only one ovary needs to meet criteria. Note that some healthy young women have polycystic-appearing ovaries without PCOS.",
    "Assess metabolic status: screen for **diabetes** (e.g., 2-hr OGTT) and check **lipid profile** and blood pressure in all patients."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "name": "Hypothyroidism",
      "hint": "↓Thyroid function (↑TSH) causes weight gain and menstrual irregularity"
    },
    {
      "name": "Hyperprolactinemia",
      "hint": "Elevated prolactin (e.g., prolactinoma) → anovulation, often with galactorrhea"
    },
    {
      "name": "Nonclassical CAH",
      "hint": "21-hydroxylase deficiency (partial); high 17‑OHP, adrenal androgen excess"

  "tricks": [
    "**2 out of 3 rule**: **Polycystic ovaries** are *not* required to diagnose PCOS if hyperandrogenism and oligo/anovulation are present.",
    "Mnemonic **HAIR-AN** – a subset of PCOS with **H**yper**A**ndrogenism, **I**nsulin **R**esistance, **A**canthosis **N**igricans (severe insulin resistance phenotype).",
    "Think of the *string-of-pearls* sign on ultrasound – multiple small follicles line the ovarian periphery (classic PCOS finding)."

  "exam_appearance": [
    "Obese 25‑year‑old woman with **amenorrhea**, **hirsutism**, and **acanthosis nigricans**; bilateral enlarged ovaries with many small follicles on ultrasound → **PCOS** (hyperandrogenic anovulation).",
    "28‑year‑old woman with known PCOS struggling to conceive → anovulatory **infertility** due to PCOS; first-line treatment is **weight loss** plus **letrozole** for ovulation induction."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Lifestyle:** Weight loss (diet & exercise) is first-line for overweight patients; even a 5–10% reduction can restore ovulation and improve metabolic health.",
    "If not seeking pregnancy: **Combined hormonal contraceptives** (e.g., OCPs) are first-line to regulate cycles and lower androgen levels (improving acne, hirsutism). Add **spironolactone** for hirsutism if needed (after 6 months on OCP). Topical eflornithine or laser hair removal can help refractory facial hair.",
    "**Metformin:** An insulin-sensitizing agent used to address metabolic issues (prediabetes, BMI >25); it often helps restore regular menses and is added for women with glucose intolerance or metabolic syndrome.",
    "If seeking pregnancy: **Ovulation induction** is indicated. First-line is **letrozole** (aromatase inhibitor) due to higher ovulation and live-birth rates than clomiphene. Clomiphene (SERM) is an alternative. If these fail, use second-line therapies (exogenous gonadotropins or assisted reproduction such as IVF).",
    "Prevent endometrial hyperplasia: ensure at least ~4 menses per year. If not on OCP, induce a withdrawal bleed every 1–3 months with **progesterone** (e.g., medroxyprogesterone) or use a progestin IUD."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Signs of **virilization** (voice deepening, clitoromegaly) or very rapid onset of symptoms → evaluate for an **androgen-secreting tumor** (not typical PCOS).",
    "Prolonged **amenorrhea** (chronic anovulation) without treatment → risk of **endometrial hyperplasia/cancer** from unopposed estrogen."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Suspected PCOS (irregular menses + hyperandrogenism) → first exclude **pregnancy**, **thyroid dysfunction**, **hyperprolactinemia**, and CAH.",
    "If ≥2 of 3 PCOS features (**androgen excess**, **ovulatory dysfunction**, ± polycystic ovaries) are present and other causes are ruled out → **diagnose PCOS**. Pelvic ultrasound can support the diagnosis if needed.",
    "If patient desires fertility → lifestyle changes (weight loss) + **ovulation induction** (letrozole is first-line).",
    "If patient does not desire pregnancy → **OCPs** to regulate menses and manage hyperandrogenism; add **spironolactone** if needed for hirsutism.",
    "Address **metabolic risk**: regular diabetes screening (OGTT every 3–5 years), lipid panel, blood pressure; consider **metformin** for insulin resistance."
