  "why_it_matters": "Most common **gynecologic cancer** in developed countries (incidence rising with obesity). Often detected early (due to abnormal bleeding) and curable, but aggressive subtypes have high mortality.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Postmenopausal **vaginal bleeding** is endometrial cancer until proven otherwise (e.g., an obese 65-year-old with new bleeding, or a postmenopausal breast cancer patient on **tamoxifen**).",
    "Premenopausal women with chronic **anovulation** (PCOS) can develop endometrial hyperplasia and present with irregular, heavy menstrual bleeding in their 40s.",
    "Advanced cases may cause pelvic pain, mass effect (enlarged uterus), or weight loss. Occasionally, a Pap smear finds atypical glandular cells pointing to an endometrial lesion."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Any suspicious uterine bleeding → obtain an **endometrial biopsy** (office pipelle or D&C) for histologic diagnosis.",
    "In postmenopausal bleeding, first do **transvaginal ultrasound**: if endometrial thickness >4 mm or polyps/mass seen, proceed to biopsy (a thin stripe <4 mm makes cancer unlikely).",
    "If biopsy confirms cancer, perform **surgical staging** (hysterectomy with BSO and lymph node evaluation). Pre-op imaging (MRI/CT) can help assess depth of invasion and metastases."

    {
      "name": "Endometrial hyperplasia",
      "hint": "precancerous thickened endometrium; causes bleeding but no stromal invasion (distinguished on biopsy)"

    "Risk factor mnemonic **HONDA**: Hypertension, Obesity, Nulliparity, Diabetes, Advanced age (all linked to unopposed estrogen exposure).",
    "**Tamoxifen** is pro-estrogenic in the uterus – prolonged use increases risk of endometrial polyps and carcinoma.",
    "**Lynch syndrome** (HNPCC) confers high risk (~50%) of endometrial cancer; such patients often need prophylactic hysterectomy after childbearing."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Obese, hypertensive 61-year-old woman with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding → endometrial carcinoma (unopposed estrogen leading to endometrioid adenocarcinoma).",
    "55-year-old breast cancer survivor on **tamoxifen** with an 8 mm endometrial stripe on ultrasound and vaginal spotting → endometrial carcinoma (tamoxifen-induced).",
    "45-year-old with **PCOS**, obesity, and chronic anovulation has prolonged irregular bleeding → endometrial carcinoma arising from long-standing endometrial hyperplasia."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Surgery** is first-line: total hysterectomy + bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TH+BSO) to remove uterus, cervix, ovaries, and fallopian tubes (surgical staging).",
    "**Radiation therapy** (vaginal brachytherapy or pelvic external beam) is added for higher-stage or high-grade disease to control local spread; **chemotherapy** (e.g., carboplatin/paclitaxel) is used for advanced stage or aggressive histology.",
    "Selective cases: **progestin** hormone therapy can treat early-stage disease in young patients desiring fertility, and **immune checkpoint inhibitors** (e.g., pembrolizumab) can be effective in metastatic MSI-high tumors."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Any **postmenopausal bleeding** is a red flag requiring prompt endometrial evaluation (could be cancer until proven otherwise).",
    "Atypical endometrial **hyperplasia** on biopsy (endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia) has high progression risk – manage definitively (usually with hysterectomy).",
    "**Serous carcinoma** histology or deep myometrial invasion indicates aggressive disease (poorer prognosis, needs aggressive treatment)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Postmenopausal bleeding → transvaginal **ultrasound** to assess endometrial thickness.",
    "If endometrium >4 mm or other suspicious findings → perform **endometrial biopsy** (office pipelle or D&C).",
    "If biopsy confirms cancer → **surgical staging** (hysterectomy + BSO with lymph node evaluation).",
    "Stage and histology guide adjuvant therapy: consider **radiation** for local control and **chemotherapy** for disseminated or high-risk disease."
