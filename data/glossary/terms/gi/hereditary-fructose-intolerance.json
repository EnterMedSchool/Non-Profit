  "definition": "Autosomal recessive inborn error of fructose metabolism due to **aldolase B** deficiency; fructose (or sucrose) ingestion triggers toxic fructose-1-phosphate accumulation → severe **hypoglycemia** and potential organ failure.",
  "why_it_matters": "Rare but potentially lethal if unrecognized—infants can have seizures or liver failure when fed fructose. Early diagnosis allows simple diet changes to prevent death or disability, making HFI a classic high-yield pediatric metabolic disorder.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Healthy newborn (breast milk only) until ~6 months; after introduction of fruit juices, baby develops **vomiting**, sweating/tremors (hypoglycemia), lethargy, and even seizures shortly after feeding. Continued fructose intake causes **jaundice**, **hepatomegaly**, and failure to thrive.",
    "Undiagnosed older infants/children may show a strong **aversion to sweets** (they refuse fruits, candy) due to learned intolerance, and may present with growth restriction and signs of liver or kidney dysfunction if fructose exposure persists."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Clue in history: infant was fine with breast milk (lactose) but got sick when **fruits or sucrose** were introduced—points to HFI (vs galactosemia, which reacts to milk).",
    "Check **urine reducing substances**: will be positive in HFI (fructosuria) even though urine dipstick is negative for glucose.",
    "If HFI is suspected, immediately **remove all fructose sources** from the diet (no further fruit, sucrose, sorbitol) and avoid any fructose-containing IV fluids or medications.",
    "Confirm diagnosis with genetic testing for **ALDOB** gene mutations or an aldolase B enzyme assay (if available). **Do not perform a fructose tolerance test** (oral fructose challenge), as it can precipitate a dangerous reaction.",
    "Differentiate from **galactosemia**: galactosemia presents in neonates fed milk (lactose/galactose) and often causes **cataracts**, whereas HFI presents after fruit/sugar introduction and does not cause cataracts."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "name": "Classic galactosemia",
      "hint": "newborn with liver failure and **cataracts** when fed breast milk/formula (Gal-1-P uridyltransferase deficiency)"
    },
    {
      "name": "Von Gierke disease (GSD I)",
      "hint": "severe fasting hypoglycemia from infancy, lactic acidosis & huge liver (glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency)"
    },
    {
      "name": "Essential fructosuria",
      "hint": "benign fructokinase deficiency; fructose in urine but no hypoglycemia or illness"
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: **FAB GUT** – Fructose (Aldolase **B** deficiency) And Galactose (UridylTransferase deficiency) to remember the enzyme defects in HFI vs galactosemia.",
    "Aldolase **B** is **B**ad (life-threatening) while fructo**K**inase is **OK**: fructokinase deficiency (essential fructosuria) is harmless."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Previously healthy 6–8 month-old who begins **fruit juices/purees**, then develops vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and **hepatomegaly** after feeding → suspect hereditary fructose intolerance.",
    "Infant with hypoglycemic seizures after eating fruit, and urine positive for reducing sugars but negative on glucose dipstick → classic lab clue for HFI."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Strict **dietary elimination** of fructose, sucrose, and sorbitol for life (no fruits, juices, table sugar, honey, syrups, etc.). Read ingredient labels carefully; even some medications/formulas contain fructose-based additives.",
    "Ensure adequate nutrition: use alternative carbohydrate sources (glucose, starches) and supplement with a sugar-free multivitamin (to provide nutrients from fruits).",
    "Manage acute episodes: if accidental fructose ingestion causes hypoglycemia or acidosis, give rapid **IV glucose** and correct metabolic disturbances (hydrate, bicarbonate if needed), while monitoring liver and kidney function."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Lethargy, vomiting, or seizure after feeding** a baby fruits or sweets → think HFI until proven otherwise (emergency—check glucose, stop fructose immediately).",
    "Unexplained acute liver failure in an infant (especially after weaning onto foods) should prompt evaluation for inborn errors like HFI."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Fructose/sucrose exposure (e.g., juices, baby food) triggers symptoms in infant → suspect HFI.",
    "If acute symptoms (seizures, etc.), stabilize (ABCs), give **IV dextrose** to reverse hypoglycemia, and eliminate any fructose sources right away.",
    "Obtain labs: check blood **glucose**, electrolytes, liver enzymes, **ABG/lactate** (lactic acidosis), and do a **urine reducing substance** test (indicates fructose/galactose in urine).",
    "Confirm HFI with genetic testing (biallelic **ALDOB** mutations) or enzyme assay on liver biopsy if needed; avoid any fructose challenge testing.",
    "Long-term: Educate caregivers and implement a life-long fructose/sucrose/sorbitol-free diet; monitor growth and liver/renal function during follow-up."
