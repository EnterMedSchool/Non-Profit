  "definition": "Autoimmune destruction of small intrahepatic bile ducts leading to chronic **cholestasis** (bile stasis) and progressive **fibrosis** of the liver (cirrhosis). Classically affects middle-aged women.",
  "why_it_matters": "PBC is a major cause of chronic **cholestatic** liver disease and can progress to **cirrhosis** and liver failure if untreated. High-yield due to its unique association with **anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA)** and effective early treatment (UDCA) to slow progression.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Typically a **woman in her 40s-60s** with insidious onset of **fatigue** and **pruritus** (itching, often worse at night). Early disease may be asymptomatic aside from elevated **alkaline phosphatase** on labs; later, patients can develop **jaundice**, **hyperpigmented** skin, and **xanthelasma** (cholesterol deposits).",
    "Strongly associated with other **autoimmune** conditions (seen in up to 70% of patients) such as **Sjögren** syndrome (dry eyes/mouth), autoimmune thyroid disease, CREST scleroderma, or rheumatoid arthritis.",
    "Exam may show **hepatomegaly** and skin excoriations from scratching. Advanced PBC leads to signs of **portal hypertension** (splenomegaly, ascites, varices) and complications of cirrhosis."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect PBC in a patient (especially a middle-aged woman) with a **cholestatic** liver enzyme pattern (**↑ALP** much more than ↑ALT) and compatible symptoms. Confirm diagnosis with **AMA** serology (anti-mitochondrial antibodies present in ~95%).",
    "Perform imaging (e.g., **ultrasound** or MRCP) to **exclude extrahepatic biliary obstruction** or **primary sclerosing cholangitis**. If **AMA-negative** but suspicion remains, or to assess disease stage, consider a **liver biopsy** (shows **nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis** and **granulomas**).",
    "Evaluate for co-existing autoimmune diseases and complications: check **thyroid** function (autoimmune thyroiditis), **bone density** (risk of osteoporosis from chronic cholestasis), and fat-soluble vitamin levels (A, D, E, K). Monitor lipid profile (PBC often causes hypercholesterolemia).",
    "If **ALT** or liver biopsy suggests interface hepatitis (hepatocellular injury) along with cholestasis, suspect **PBC-AIH overlap** syndrome; this requires additional immunosuppressive management."

  "differentials": [
    {
      "id": "primary-sclerosing-cholangitis",
      "hint": "affects young men, p-ANCA+, assoc. with ulcerative colitis; bile duct strictures on imaging"
    },
    {
      "id": "autoimmune-hepatitis",
      "hint": "hepatitic pattern (↑AST/ALT), positive ANA/SMA, high IgG; responds to steroids"
    },
    {
      "name": "Secondary biliary cirrhosis",
      "hint": "cholestatic liver injury due to prolonged extrahepatic bile duct obstruction (e.g., choledocholithiasis, stricture); usually imaging shows dilated ducts"
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Remember **M** for PBC: **M**iddle-aged **M**oms (90% female), anti-**M**itochondrial antibodies (AMA), and elevated **IgM** levels. (By contrast, **PSC** affects Sons (men) and is p-ANCA positive with UC.)",
    "Old name was \"primary biliary cirrhosis\" – think PBC when you see a cholestatic pattern in a 50-year-old woman, even if cirrhosis hasn't developed yet."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Middle-aged woman with months of **pruritus** and fatigue, lab tests show markedly **↑alkaline phosphatase**, mild ↑AST/ALT, and positive **anti-mitochondrial antibodies** → Primary biliary cholangitis.",
    "Patient with long-standing PBC now presents with **ascites**, **jaundice**, and variceal bleeding → indicates **decompensated cirrhosis** from PBC (requires transplant evaluation)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)** – first-line therapy that slows disease progression (improves cholestasis and survival); start as soon as diagnosis is made (13–15 mg/kg/day).",
    "If inadequate response to UDCA (e.g., ALP remains high at 1 year), add **obeticholic acid** (FXR agonist) as second-line. **Fibrates** (e.g., bezafibrate) are another off-label option for UDCA non-responders (avoid in decompensated cirrhosis).",
    "Manage symptoms and complications: **cholestyramine** or rifampin can help pruritus; supplement **fat-soluble vitamins**; use **bisphosphonates** for PBC-related osteoporosis. Screen for and endoscopically treat varices if portal HTN present.",
    "**Liver transplant** is indicated for end-stage PBC (decompensated cirrhosis or severe symptoms like intractable pruritus); transplant is often curative, though AMA may remain positive."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Any signs of **decompensated cirrhosis** (e.g., new-onset ascites, encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage) in PBC → urgent referral for **liver transplant** evaluation.",
    "Concomitant **high AST/ALT** and positive ANA or SMA in a PBC patient → suspect **overlap syndrome** (PBC + autoimmune hepatitis) requiring biopsy confirmation and immunosuppressive therapy (corticosteroids).",
    "Severe **pruritus** unresponsive to medical therapy is a red flag for poor quality of life – can be an indication for earlier transplant consideration."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Unexplained **cholestatic** LFT pattern (↑ALP) in an at-risk patient (especially middle-aged woman) → test **AMA** and other antibodies (ANA, etc.).",
    "If **AMA positive** (or sp100/gp210), diagnosis of PBC is likely. Obtain imaging (U/S, MRCP) to rule out extrahepatic obstruction or PSC.",
    "If **AMA negative** and imaging normal, consider **liver biopsy** to confirm PBC (will show florid duct lesions) or identify alternative diagnoses.",
    "Start **UDCA** once PBC is diagnosed (don't wait for biopsy if clinical picture is clear). Recheck liver tests at 6–12 months; if inadequate response, consider adding second-line therapy (obeticholic acid or fibrate).",
    "Monitor for progression (development of cirrhosis, varices) and manage complications. Refer for **transplant** evaluation if liver failure develops despite medical therapy."
