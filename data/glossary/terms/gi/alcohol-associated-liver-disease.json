  "definition": "Spectrum of liver injury due to chronic **alcohol** use, ranging from reversible fatty infiltration to life-threatening hepatitis and irreversible cirrhosis.",
  "why_it_matters": "A leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide (second most common cause of cirrhosis in the US after hepatitis C). Severe alcoholic hepatitis carries a high mortality (~30–50% at 1 month), so recognizing and managing AALD is critical. Frequently tested on exams for its distinct lab findings (AST:ALT ratio, GGT) and treatment decisions (steroids in acute alcoholic hepatitis).",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Often **asymptomatic** in early stages (simple steatosis); patients may have only mild RUQ discomfort or hepatomegaly. Many cases are first noted incidentally by abnormal labs (**AST** elevated more than ALT).",
    "Acute **alcoholic hepatitis** typically follows a heavy drinking bout and presents with **jaundice**, fever, anorexia, and a tender enlarged liver. Labs show moderately elevated AST and ALT (AST usually ~2× ALT, rarely >500 U/L), often with high bilirubin and neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis.",
    "Advanced **cirrhosis** from alcohol use presents with stigmata of chronic liver disease: **ascites**, spider angiomata, palmar erythema, gynecomastia, splenomegaly, etc. Decompensation leads to complications of portal hypertension (e.g. variceal hemorrhage causing hematemesis) and liver failure (encephalopathy with confusion/asterixis, coagulopathy)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect ALD in patients with long-standing heavy alcohol use and a characteristic **AST:ALT ~2:1** pattern (AST often <300 U/L). Supporting labs include elevated **GGT** and **MCV** (macrocytosis) from chronic alcohol use.",
    "Exclude other causes of liver injury: check **viral hepatitis** serologies, review medications for **drug-induced liver injury**, consider **autoimmune** markers and **Wilson disease** (in younger patients). Perform imaging (ultrasound) to rule out biliary obstruction or masses; liver biopsy is reserved for uncertain cases (bearing in mind coagulopathy risks).",
    "Assess severity in alcoholic hepatitis using prognostic scores. Calculate **Maddrey's discriminant function (DF)** (uses PT and bilirubin) and **MELD** score (uses bilirubin, INR, creatinine ± sodium). A DF ≥32 or MELD ≥20 correlates with ~50% 1-month mortality and indicates severe disease (consider steroids). Also evaluate for hepatic encephalopathy or rapidly rising INR, which signal acute liver failure risk.",
    "Address management priorities: foremost **stop alcohol** (enforce abstinence, involve addiction support) and provide **nutritional** rehabilitation (high-protein diet if possible, replete **thiamine**, folate, etc.). In severe alcoholic hepatitis (DF ≥32 or high MELD), begin **corticosteroids** (e.g. prednisolone 40 mg/day for 4 weeks) after ruling out infection or GI bleeding. If steroids are contraindicated, start **pentoxifylline** as an alternative.",
    "Monitor response to therapy: if on steroids, check a 7-day **Lille score** (assesses bilirubin change). A Lille >0.45 (poor response) → stop steroids; a Lille ≤0.45 → continue the 4-week course. Concurrently treat any cirrhosis complications (e.g. diuretics & paracentesis for ascites, beta-blockers and endoscopy for varices, lactulose for encephalopathy). For end-stage ALD, arrange evaluation for **liver transplant** once sobriety is established (typically ≥6 months)."

    {
      "id": "non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease",
      "hint": "Metabolic risk factors (obesity, diabetes); similar spectrum (NAFLD/NASH) but in minimal/no alcohol use. ALT often > AST (AST:ALT <1)."
    },
    {
      "id": "viral-hepatitis",
      "hint": "Hepatitis B or C (or acute A) can mimic liver injury. Usually ALT > AST (often into 1000s in acute viral), positive viral serologies."
    },
    {
      "id": "drug-induced-liver-injury",
      "hint": "Medication/toxin-related hepatitis (e.g. acetaminophen overdose causes very high AST/ALT, different history)."
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "**AST > ALT** (~2:1) in **A**lcoholic liver damage (think \"A **S**cotch and **T**onic\" for AST) – contrast with viral hepatitis (ALT tends to be higher). Alcohol causes vitamin B6 depletion, limiting ALT elevation.",
    "**Mallory bodies** (eosinophilic Mallory–Denk hyaline inclusions) are classically associated with alcoholic hepatitis. They represent tangled intermediate filaments in hepatocytes and also appear in other diseases (e.g. NASH, Wilson's).",
    "Chronic alcohol use often raises **GGT** (gamma-glutamyl transferase) and causes **macrocytosis** (↑MCV) on CBC – useful lab clues pointing to alcohol as the etiology."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Middle-aged patient with long-term heavy drinking found to have mildly elevated LFTs (AST 150, ALT 70; AST:ALT ~2:1) and an elevated **GGT** → suggests alcoholic fatty liver disease.",
    "Patient after a binge presents with **painful hepatomegaly**, fever, and new jaundice → acute alcoholic **hepatitis** (look for AST ~2× ALT and neutrophils on biopsy with Mallory bodies).",
    "Known alcoholic with **cirrhosis** develops hematemesis and melena → likely **variceal bleed** from portal hypertension (common in alcoholic cirrhosis). Another scenario: chronic drinker with confusion and asterixis → think **hepatic encephalopathy** due to decompensated ALD."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Complete abstinence** from alcohol – the single most important intervention (can stabilize or improve early disease). Provide nutritional support (high-protein diet if no encephalopathy) and replace vitamins (**thiamine**, folate, etc.).",
    "**Corticosteroids** for severe alcoholic hepatitis (if DF ≥32 or MELD ≥20): e.g. prednisolone 40 mg daily for 4 weeks. Must first rule out active infection or GI bleeding (contraindications). If steroids contraindicated or not effective, use **pentoxifylline** (400 mg TID × 4 weeks) as an alternative (modest benefit).",
    "**Manage cirrhosis** complications: Nonselective **β-blockers** (e.g. nadolol) and periodic endoscopic banding to prevent variceal hemorrhage; **diuretics** (spironolactone ± furosemide) and paracentesis for ascites; **lactulose** (plus rifaximin) for encephalopathy, etc. Screen for HCC every 6 months. Consider **liver transplant** for end-stage alcoholic cirrhosis, typically after ≥6 months of documented sobriety."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Any signs of **decompensation** in ALD: new-onset tense **ascites** (risk of SBP), variceal **GI bleeding** (hematemesis), or **encephalopathy** (confusion, asterixis) indicate severe disease and warrant urgent evaluation.",
    "Severe alcoholic hepatitis with **jaundice** and **coagulopathy** (e.g. INR >1.5) plus **hepatic encephalopathy** signifies a high risk of liver failure and death (high short-term mortality) – ICU care and specialist intervention needed."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Chronic heavy alcohol use + abnormal LFTs (AST > ALT) → suspect ALD. Take a thorough alcohol history and obtain labs (AST, ALT, bilirubin, INR, CBC, metabolic panel).",
    "Exclude other etiologies: test viral hepatitis panel; perform abdominal ultrasound to rule out biliary obstruction or masses. If diagnosis remains uncertain, consider liver **biopsy** (careful if coagulopathic).",
    "If **alcoholic hepatitis** is present (e.g. patient with jaundice): calculate severity scores (**Maddrey DF**, **MELD**). Severe cases (DF ≥32 or MELD ~≥20) → begin **steroid** therapy, provided no infection or bleeding is ongoing.",
    "Provide aggressive **supportive care** throughout: IV fluids, correct electrolytes, **nutritional** support (enteral feeding if needed), and prevent alcohol withdrawal (use benzodiazepines like lorazepam if high risk). Treat intercurrent infections promptly (frequent in severe ALD).",
    "Reassess in 1 week if on steroids (compute **Lille score**). If Lille >0.45 (poor response) → stop steroids. If improving, continue full 4-week course. Ensure plans for long-term **abstinence** (rehab, support groups) and follow closely. Refer for **transplant** evaluation in patients with end-stage disease once a period of sobriety is achieved."

The high bilirubin and prolonged INR indicate severe alcoholic hepatitis (Maddrey's DF likely >32), which has high short-term mortality. Management would include **corticosteroids** (after ruling out infection), aggressive supportive care, and absolute alcohol abstinence."
