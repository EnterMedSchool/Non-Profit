  "definition": "Benign inherited (usually autosomal recessive) condition of reduced bilirubin **UDP-glucuronosyltransferase** (*UGT1A1*) activity; causes mild isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (intermittent jaundice).",
  "why_it_matters": "Very common (≈3–10% of people) benign cause of jaundice. Recognizing it prevents unnecessary workup and anxiety. Often tested as the harmless \"red herring\" in jaundice cases to contrast with serious liver diseases.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Usually **asymptomatic** aside from episodes of mild jaundice (scleral icterus) in an otherwise healthy teen or young adult.",
    "Jaundice is often triggered by **stress**: for example, illness (like a cold/flu), **fasting** (skipping meals), **dehydration**, strenuous exercise, or menstruation.",
    "Labs show **isolated ↑unconjugated bilirubin** (typically 2–4 mg/dL) with **normal** liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP) and normal hemoglobin/reticulocyte count."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect Gilbert if unconjugated bilirubin is mildly elevated but **ALT/AST and CBC are normal** (isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia).",
    "Exclude other causes: check for **hemolysis** (if anemia or ↑retic count, do Coombs test, etc.) and for liver injury (if ALT/AST are elevated or if direct bilirubin ↑, evaluate for hepatitis or cholestasis).",
    "No invasive workup is needed in classic cases. Historically, a **48-hour fast** will provoke a bilirubin rise in Gilbert, and genetic testing (*UGT1A1* mutation) can confirm the diagnosis – but this is rarely necessary."

    {
      "name": "Hemolysis (hemolytic anemia)",
      "hint": "↑Unconjugated bilirubin but with anemia, ↑reticulocytes, ↑LDH (evidence of RBC destruction)"

    {
      "name": "Hepatitis or liver injury",
      "hint": "Mixed direct & indirect bilirubin; typically **elevated AST/ALT** and other liver function abnormalities"

      "id": "crigler-najjar-syndrome",
      "name": "Crigler-Najjar syndrome",
      "hint": "Rare, severe UGT1A1 deficiency (very high bilirubin from infancy; kernicterus in Type I, milder Type II)"
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: **CGI** – **C**rigler-Najjar and **G**ilbert cause **I**ndirect (unconjugated) bilirubin elevation, whereas Dubin-Johnson & Rotor syndromes cause direct bilirubin elevation.",
    "**Gilbert = mild**, **Crigler-Najjar = severe**: Gilbert never causes kernicterus or real harm, in contrast to Crigler-Najjar type I (fatal without transplant)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Young adult with transient **scleral icterus** after fasting or illness, but **normal** physical exam and normal liver labs → benign **Gilbert syndrome** (isolated unconjugated bilirubin elevation).",
    "Incidental finding of mildly **↑indirect bilirubin** (~2–3 mg/dL) on routine labs in an otherwise healthy patient (with normal AST/ALT and no anemia) → likely Gilbert syndrome (no treatment needed)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "No specific treatment needed – **reassurance** is key (it's a harmless condition).",
    "Avoid extreme **fasting** or dehydration to reduce the frequency of jaundice episodes, but no medication or special therapy is required."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Jaundice accompanied by **weight loss**, abdominal pain, or general illness → not Gilbert; consider serious causes (e.g., malignancy, hepatitis).",
    "**Abnormal liver tests** (elevated ALT/AST or ALP, or high direct bilirubin) → points to true liver pathology (Gilbert's labs should otherwise be normal)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Noticed mild jaundice or isolated bilirubin rise → check bilirubin fraction (direct vs indirect) and other labs (LFTs, CBC).",
    "If **indirect bilirubin** is elevated with normal AST/ALT and normal hemoglobin → Gilbert syndrome likely (benign).",
    "If signs of **hemolysis** (anemia, ↑retic count) are present → investigate hemolytic causes (Coombs test, G6PD, etc.).",
    "If **direct bilirubin** is elevated or liver enzymes are abnormal → evaluate for liver/biliary disease (viral hepatitis panel, ultrasound imaging, etc.).",
    "Confirmed Gilbert syndrome → educate and reassure (no invasive workup or treatment needed)."

Normal hemoglobin (no hemolysis) and normal liver enzymes (no hepatitis) help confirm that it's Gilbert syndrome; no treatment is required."
