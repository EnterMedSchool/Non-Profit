  "definition": "Rare autosomal recessive **copper metabolism** disorder (*ATP7B* mutation) causing toxic **copper accumulation** in tissues (especially liver & basal ganglia).",
  "why_it_matters": "Often **fatal if untreated** (due to progressive cirrhosis and neurodegeneration). Early recognition allows **chelation** therapy to prevent irreversible hepatic and neurologic damage.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Hepatic presentation (most common): typically in adolescence with signs of chronic liver disease (**hepatitis** → **cirrhosis**). Can present as **acute liver failure** (fulminant hepatitis with coagulopathy), often accompanied by **Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia**.",
    "Neuropsychiatric presentation: usually young adults with movement disorders (**tremor**, **dystonia**, **parkinsonian** features) and personality or mood changes (depression, irritability). **Kayser-Fleischer rings** (brown copper deposits at the corneal limbus) are often present on slit-lamp exam when neurologic symptoms occur."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Maintain a high index of suspicion in any young patient with unexplained **liver disease** or atypical **movement/psychiatric** disorder — Wilson disease is treatable and often missed.",
    "Screen with **ceruloplasmin** level (low <20 mg/dL in ~90% of cases, though can be normal in inflammation or rare cases). If low (or clinical suspicion remains high), proceed with confirmatory tests.",
    "Confirm the diagnosis with a **24-hour urine copper** (elevated copper excretion) and slit-lamp exam for Kayser-Fleischer rings; if needed, perform liver biopsy for quantitative copper or **genetic testing** for *ATP7B* mutations.",
    "Recognize that other conditions can also lower ceruloplasmin (e.g. protein-losing states, malnutrition) — interpret labs in context. In acute liver failure, a very low alkaline phosphatase with high AST and hemolysis strongly suggests Wilson disease.",
    "Start **copper chelation** therapy as soon as Wilson disease is diagnosed; do not delay treatment, as ongoing copper accumulation leads to permanent organ damage. Also screen first-degree relatives for Wilson disease."

  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: **Copper is Hella BAD** – **C**opper accumulation (↓**ceruloplasmin**, cirrhosis, corneal deposits, carcinoma risk), **H**emolysis, **B**asal ganglia degeneration (movement disorder), **A**sterixis (from liver failure), **D**ementia/**dysarthria**.",
    "**Penicillamine** can be remembered as a 'penny' (copper coin) – it's the first-line chelator to treat copper overload."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Teenager with **jaundice**, **asterixis**, and **acute liver failure** (↑AST/ALT into 1000s) plus Coombs–negative hemolytic anemia; slit-lamp shows corneal deposits (Kayser-Fleischer rings) → Wilson disease.",
    "Young adult with a resting tremor, **dysarthria**, personality changes, and mildly ↑LFTs; slit-lamp exam reveals **Kayser-Fleischer rings** in the cornea → Wilson disease."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Lifelong copper removal: **chelators** like D-penicillamine (first-line) or **trientine** to bind and excrete copper; plus high-dose **zinc** to block copper absorption and a low-copper diet (avoid organ meats, shellfish, nuts, chocolate).",
    "**Liver transplant** for fulminant Wilson disease or end-stage cirrhosis (curative by restoring normal copper excretion)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Fulminant Wilson disease** – acute liver failure with rapid hemolysis in a young patient – is an emergency; without **transplant** it has a high fatality. Always consider Wilson disease in any unexplained acute hepatic failure in a teenager.",
    "Non-adherence or stopping chelation can lead to re-accumulation of copper and sudden **neurologic deterioration**. Emphasize strict lifelong therapy to prevent irreversible damage."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Young patient with unexplained liver dysfunction or neuropsychiatric symptoms → **suspect Wilson disease**.",
    "Initial tests: check **serum ceruloplasmin** (low in most cases) and liver enzymes; also examine eyes (slit lamp) for Kayser-Fleischer rings.",
    "If ceruloplasmin is low (or high suspicion persists): confirm with **24h urinary copper** (elevated) and/or **liver biopsy** for copper; perform *ATP7B* **genetic testing** to solidify diagnosis and for family screening.",
    "Begin **chelation therapy** (e.g. D-penicillamine) promptly upon diagnosis; add **zinc** to reduce dietary copper uptake. Avoid high-copper foods.",
    "If patient develops **acute liver failure** or has decompensated cirrhosis despite therapy → refer for **liver transplantation** (definitive cure)."

Copper deposition in the basal ganglia leads to tremors and dysarthria, often alongside liver enzyme elevations. The presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings is classic. Treatment with copper chelators (e.g., penicillamine) can improve neurologic symptoms if started early."
