  "definition": "Syndrome caused by a gastrin-secreting tumor (**gastrinoma**) leading to excessive gastric **acid hypersecretion** and multiple refractory **peptic ulcers**.",
  "why_it_matters": "Causes **hard-to-treat ulcers** and chronic diarrhea; often appears on exams as a classic cause of **refractory peptic ulcer disease**, sometimes as part of **MEN1**.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Severe, **recurrent peptic ulcers** (often multiple and in atypical locations like distal duodenum or **jejunum**) plus **chronic diarrhea** (acid inactivates pancreatic enzymes, causing malabsorption).",
    "Ulcers that **fail to heal** with standard therapy (high-dose PPI) or without H. pylori/NSAIDs history → raises suspicion for ZES.",
    "In 20–25% cases, part of **MEN1** (patients may also show **kidney stones** from hyperparathyroidism or pituitary tumor signs)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Measure **fasting gastrin** level off acid suppression (gastrin >1000 pg/mL with gastric pH <2 is essentially diagnostic of ZES). If gastrin is moderately elevated (e.g. 200–1000), proceed with confirmatory testing.",
    "Perform a **secretin stimulation test** for equivocal cases: in ZES, secretin paradoxically causes a large gastrin rise (≥120 pg/mL above baseline is a positive test).",
    "Check gastric acid levels: **gastric pH ≤2** (with high gastrin) supports ZES vs other causes of high gastrin like atrophic gastritis (which causes low acid/high pH).",
    "Localize the gastrinoma with imaging: **somatostatin receptor PET/CT** (Ga-68 dotatate) is highly sensitive; also consider **endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)** for duodenal/pancreatic tumors.",
    "Screen for **MEN1** in confirmed ZES: check for hyperparathyroidism (**calcium**, **PTH** levels) and pituitary tumors (prolactin, etc)."

    "Peptic ulcers in unusual locations (e.g. post-bulbar duodenum or jejunum) or multiple ulcers **→ suspect ZES** instead of ordinary PUD."
  ],

    "Middle-aged patient with **multiple ulcers** and chronic diarrhea, very high gastrin level → Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma).",
    "Young adult with refractory ulcers plus **kidney stones** (hypercalcemia) → MEN1 syndrome (gastrinoma with hyperparathyroidism).",
    "**Secretin injection** leads to a marked rise in gastrin levels → positive secretin stimulation test (confirms ZES)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**High-dose PPIs** are first-line to control acid hypersecretion and heal ulcers (e.g. omeprazole ~60 mg/day, much higher than standard GERD doses).",
    "Surgical **tumor resection** if feasible: can be curative for localized gastrinomas (especially sporadic tumors >2 cm); MEN1 cases often have multiple small tumors (surgery targeted if large lesions).",
    "For metastatic or unresectable ZES: use **somatostatin analogs** (octreotide) to reduce gastrin and slow tumor, and consider targeted therapies (e.g. **everolimus**, **PRRT** with radiolabeled octreotide) in advanced disease."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Ulcers in **atypical locations** (distal duodenum/jejunum) or multiple ulcers that don't respond to therapy → **red flag for ZES** (do not just treat as routine PUD).",
    "Stopping PPIs for diagnostic testing can cause acid rebound – monitor closely for ulcer bleeding or perforation during workup.",
    "Diagnosed ZES patients should be evaluated for **MEN1** signs (hypercalcemia, pituitary issues) – missing MEN1 means missing other tumors."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Refractory or multiple ulcers ± diarrhea → **suspect ZES**.",
    "Hold acid-suppressing meds if possible and obtain **fasting gastrin** level (plus gastric pH).",
    "If gastrin is modestly elevated → perform **secretin stimulation test** (positive = big gastrin rise).",
    "If ZES confirmed biochemically → **localize tumor** with imaging (Ga-68 dotatate PET, EUS, CT/MRI).",
    "Manage with high-dose **PPI** for acid control, **resect tumor** if localized (and screen for MEN1)."
