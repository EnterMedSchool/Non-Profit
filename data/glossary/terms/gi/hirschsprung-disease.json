  "definition": "Congenital absence of **enteric ganglion cells** in the distal colon (aganglionosis) → failure of relaxation and **functional obstruction**, with proximal colon dilation (**megacolon**).",
  "why_it_matters": "Important cause of neonatal intestinal obstruction and pediatric constipation. If untreated, it can lead to life-threatening **enterocolitis** (**toxic megacolon**). Frequently tested on exams (e.g., newborn who fails to pass meconium, often with **Down syndrome**).",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Newborn with **failure to pass meconium** in the first 48 hours of life, plus **bilious vomiting** and progressive abdominal distension. Digital rectal exam often produces an **explosive discharge** of stool and gas (\"squirt sign\"), briefly relieving the obstruction.",
    "Older infants or children with a short aganglionic segment may present later with chronic **constipation**, poor feeding or **failure to thrive**, and a distended abdomen. On exam, the rectum is empty (no stool in vault despite fecal impaction higher up), and stools may be thin or \"ribbon-like.\""
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect Hirschsprung in a neonate with delayed meconium >48 h or a child with lifelong constipation.",
    "Obtain a contrast **barium enema** to look for a **transition zone** – a narrow distal segment and dilated proximal colon.",
    "Perform anorectal **manometry**: Hirschsprung disease shows absence of the normal rectoanal inhibitory reflex (internal sphincter fails to relax).",
    "Confirm the diagnosis with a rectal **suction biopsy** (gold standard) demonstrating absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal/myenteric plexus."

  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: **No meconium = no ganglion** – >48 h without stool in a newborn (especially with Down syndrome) → suspect Hirschsprung.",
    "**Squirt sign**: explosive gas/stool release upon rectal exam is classic for Hirschsprung disease.",
    "A **neurocristopathy**: failed neural crest cell migration causes the aganglionic segment (Hirschsprung is associated with RET proto-oncogene mutations, also seen in MEN2A)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Newborn (± **Down syndrome**) with no meconium in 48 h, bilious vomiting, and a distended abdomen; forceful stool explosion on DRE → Hirschsprung disease.",
    "Toddler with chronic constipation since birth, abdominal distension, poor weight gain, and an empty rectal vault on exam → short-segment Hirschsprung disease."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Stabilize initially: relieve obstruction with rectal irrigations or a stoma; treat enterocolitis with bowel decompression and IV antibiotics.",
    "Definitive treatment is surgical. Remove the aganglionic segment and connect the normal proximal colon to the anus (**pull-through** procedure). A temporary ostomy may be done first in ill infants or long-segment disease, followed by the final pull-through."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis**: presents with fever, explosive diarrhea, abdominal distension, and signs of sepsis/shock. This **toxic megacolon** complication is life-threatening – requires urgent bowel decompression (e.g., rectal tube or ostomy) and broad-spectrum antibiotics."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Neonate with no meconium in 48 h or child with chronic constipation → suspect Hirschsprung disease.",
    "Abdominal X-ray to assess obstruction; then do contrast **enema** to identify a transition zone (narrow distal, dilated proximal).",
    "If suspicion remains high, perform anorectal **manometry** (lack of sphincter relaxation suggests aganglionosis).",
    "Confirm by rectal **biopsy** showing no ganglion cells in the submucosa/myenteric plexus (aganglionosis).",
    "Management: if acute obstruction or enterocolitis, decompress bowel (rectal tube or ostomy) and stabilize. Then perform definitive **surgical resection** of the aganglionic segment with a pull-through anastomosis."

An empty rectum despite a palpable fecal mass in the colon is a key finding distinguishing it from functional constipation. A rectal biopsy is diagnostic, and surgical resection of the aganglionic segment is curative."
