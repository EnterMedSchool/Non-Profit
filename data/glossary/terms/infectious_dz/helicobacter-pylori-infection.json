  "definition": "A common spiral-shaped, urease-producing **Gram-negative** bacterium that colonizes the gastric mucosa; causes chronic gastritis and most peptic ulcers, and is a known risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma and MALT lymphoma.",
  "why_it_matters": "Infects roughly **half** of the world's population and is the leading cause of **peptic ulcer disease** (over 90% of duodenal ulcers). Identifying and eradicating H. pylori not only heals ulcers (preventing recurrence) but also lowers the risk of gastric cancer (it's classified as a **Group 1 carcinogen** by WHO).",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Often **asymptomatic** initially. When symptoms occur, chronic **dyspepsia** is common – gnawing or burning epigastric pain (classically worse when the stomach is empty, e.g. at night), sometimes relieved by eating.",
    "Suspect H. pylori in a patient with an **ulcer** but no NSAID use (especially a duodenal ulcer in a younger adult). Infection is usually acquired in childhood (more prevalent in crowded, low-sanitation settings) and can persist for decades.",
    "Ulcer complications: **GI bleeding** (hematemesis, melena, iron-deficiency anemia) or perforation (acute abdomen). Long-standing infection can lead to atrophic gastritis and hence gastric **cancer** – so weight loss, progressive dysphagia, or other alarm features warrant prompt evaluation."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "For patients <60 with dyspepsia and no red flags, follow a **test-and-treat** approach: perform a noninvasive H. pylori test (urea breath test or stool antigen); if positive, proceed with eradication therapy (if negative, consider other causes or endoscopy).",
    "If **alarm features** are present or patient is ≥60, skip straight to **endoscopy** with biopsy for H. pylori testing and to exclude malignancy.",
    "Avoid false negatives: stop **PPIs** for ~2 weeks and antibiotics for ~4 weeks before testing for H. pylori (acid suppression and recent antibiotics can suppress the bacteria and yield false-negative results).",
    "After treatment, always confirm **eradication** – usually with a urea breath or stool antigen test ≥4 weeks after therapy (especially important if the patient had an ulcer, MALT lymphoma, or persistent symptoms).",
    "If initial therapy fails, use a **salvage regimen** with different antibiotics (avoid repeating clarithromycin or metronidazole). Consider culture and sensitivity testing after multiple treatment failures."

  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic for therapy: **CAP** = Clarithromycin + Amoxicillin + PPI (triple therapy); **PBMT** = PPI + Bismuth + Metronidazole + Tetracycline (bismuth quadruple therapy).",
    "**Urease-positive**: H. pylori produces urease (ammonia cloud) to alkalinize its surroundings – basis for the **urea breath test** and rapid urease (CLO) test on biopsy.",
    "H. pylori is implicated in >90% of duodenal ulcers and ~75% of gastric ulcers. An exam tip: an ulcer patient without NSAID use → think H. pylori."

  "exam_appearance": [
    "Middle-aged adult with burning epigastric pain that improves after meals and wakes them at night; no NSAID use, positive urea breath test → **H. pylori–associated duodenal ulcer**.",
    "Gastric biopsy showing low-grade **MALT lymphoma** → treating the H. pylori infection can lead to lymphoma regression.",
    "Patient with long-standing H. pylori gastritis who has new weight loss and early satiety → suspect **gastric adenocarcinoma** developing (H. pylori as a key risk factor)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "First-line (in regions of low resistance): **clarithromycin-based triple therapy** – a PPI + clarithromycin + amoxicillin for 14 days (if penicillin-allergic, substitute metronidazole for amoxicillin).",
    "If high local clarithromycin resistance or prior macrolide exposure: use **bismuth quadruple therapy** – PPI + bismuth subsalicylate + metronidazole + tetracycline for 14 days (an alternative 4-drug regimen is PPI + clarithromycin + amoxicillin + metronidazole).",
    "After completion of therapy, confirm eradication (urea breath or stool test ≥4 weeks later). If H. pylori persists, switch to a salvage regimen using different antibiotics (e.g., levofloxacin- or rifabutin-based triple therapy)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Alarm features** suggesting cancer or complicated ulcer: unintentional weight loss, progressive dysphagia, **GI bleeding** (melena, hematemesis) or anemia, persistent vomiting, or palpable mass → indicate need for immediate endoscopic evaluation.",
    "Ulcer that is **refractory** (won't heal) despite therapy → suspect treatment failure or an alternate cause (e.g., noncompliance, persistent H. pylori, NSAIDs, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, or malignancy)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Dyspepsia or ulcer symptoms → check for red flags.",
    "If **no alarm features and age <60** → noninvasive H. pylori test (urea breath or stool antigen).",
    "If test positive → treat with eradication regimen; if negative → consider other causes (GERD, functional dyspepsia) or proceed to endoscopy if symptoms persist.",
    "If **alarm features or age ≥60** → perform endoscopy with biopsy (for H. pylori detection and to rule out gastric malignancy).",
    "After treatment, perform a **test-of-cure** (urea breath test or stool antigen) ≥4 weeks later to ensure H. pylori eradication."
