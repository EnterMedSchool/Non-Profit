  "definition": "Life-threatening neurologic illness caused by *Clostridium tetani* exotoxin (**tetanospasmin**), characterized by muscle rigidity and intense spasms (classically beginning with **lockjaw**).",
  "why_it_matters": "Despite being vaccine-preventable, tetanus still causes fatalities in under-immunized patients and resource-poor regions. Early recognition is critical for timely treatment (airway support, antitoxin) and is a classic exam scenario highlighting wound management and immunization status.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "**Trismus** (lockjaw) is usually the first symptom, along with neck stiffness and dysphagia, appearing about a week after an injury. The muscle rigidity then generalizes downward, causing board-like abdominal wall and limb stiffness.",
    "Facial muscle contraction produces a forced grin (**risus sardonicus**) and severe extensor spasms can lead to **opisthotonus** (exaggerated arching of the back) in advanced cases.",
    "Spasms are extremely painful and often triggered by minor stimuli (e.g. light, noise, touch). Importantly, patients remain **conscious** and have **no sensory deficits** during these episodes (tetanus affects motor neurons, not sensory)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect tetanus in any patient with a recent wound and new-onset **jaw stiffness or muscle spasms** – especially if they have not been fully vaccinated. Diagnosis is **clinical** (no rapid lab test), so begin treatment promptly rather than waiting for cultures.",
    "Management requires addressing four priorities: **remove the source** (aggressive wound debridement + antibiotics), **neutralize the toxin** (give antitoxin **TIG**), **control muscle spasms** (benzodiazepines as first-line), and **support vital functions** (airway protection, quiet environment)."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "name": "Strychnine poisoning",
      "hint": "Similar convulsive muscle spasms but lacks the autonomic dysfunction of tetanus; usually from ingesting rodent poison or tainted drugs."
    },
    {
      "name": "Acute dystonic reaction",
      "hint": "Drug-induced muscle contractions (e.g. neck/jaw dystonia from antipsychotics) can mimic lockjaw, but occurs in context of medication use and without a wound or generalized spasms."
    },
    {
      "name": "Hypocalcemic tetany",
      "hint": "Muscle cramps/tetany from low calcium can cause carpal spasms and paresthesias, but not the severe sustained contractions or autonomic instability seen in tetanus."
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Tetanus vs **botulism**: Tetanus toxin blocks inhibitory neurons (GABA/glycine) causing **spastic** paralysis, whereas botulinum toxin blocks ACh release causing **flaccid** paralysis. Think \"tetanic = tense\" and \"botulism = limp.\"",
    "Know the abbreviations: **TIG** = Tetanus Immune Globulin (passive antibodies to neutralize toxin). **TT/Td/Tdap** = tetanus toxoid vaccines (active immunity; *Tdap* includes pertussis) given for routine immunization and boosters."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Unvaccinated adult with a **puncture wound** (rusty nail) 5–10 days ago, now presenting with **lockjaw**, painful muscle spasms (often induced by loud sounds or touch), and an arched back posture (**opisthotonus**) → **Tetanus**.",
    "Newborn (1 week old) born via an **unsanitary delivery** who develops inability to breastfeed, **trismus**, and body rigidity a few days after birth → **Neonatal tetanus** (infection of the umbilical stump)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Wound care + antibiotics:** Thoroughly debride the wound and give antibiotics (first-line **metronidazole**) to eradicate *C. tetani* and halt toxin production.",
    "**Neutralize toxin:** Administer human **tetanus immune globulin (TIG)** as soon as possible to bind unbound toxin. Also **give tetanus toxoid vaccine** (active immunization) once the patient is stable, because tetanus infection does not confer lasting immunity.",
    "**Supportive care:** Control muscle spasms with benzodiazepines (e.g. IV diazepam) and minimize external stimuli (quiet, dark environment). Monitor in ICU; be prepared for **airway support** (intubation) if laryngospasm or respiratory failure threatens."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Autonomic instability** (labile blood pressure, arrhythmias, high fever, profuse sweating) indicates severe tetanus and a high risk of complications. Intensive care and aggressive management are required.",
    "**Respiratory compromise** from **laryngospasm** or chest wall rigidity is the leading cause of death in tetanus. Early intubation and mechanical ventilation can be life-saving if there are signs of airway obstruction or apnea."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Wound + muscle spasms → **Suspect tetanus** (clinical diagnosis)",
    "**Clean the wound** thoroughly (debridement) + start **metronidazole**",
    "**TIG** IM (passive antitoxin) **+ Tetanus toxoid vaccine** (active immunization)",
    "**Sedation & airway**: Give benzodiazepines for spasms; intubate if needed; ICU supportive care"
  ],
  "cases": [
    {
      "stem": "A 52‑year‑old man with no recent immunizations stepped on a rusty nail 7 days ago. He now reports stiffness of the jaw and neck, difficulty swallowing, and episodes of severe muscle spasms triggered by loud noises. During these episodes he has a grimacing smile and his back arches rigidly, though he remains alert.",

        "Preserved consciousness"
      ],
      "answer": "Tetanus",
      "teaching": "This is a classic presentation of generalized tetanus caused by *Clostridium tetani* infection. The dirty puncture wound allowed bacterial spores to germinate and release **tetanospasmin**, a neurotoxin that blocks inhibitory neurotransmitters, leading to uncontrolled muscle contractions. Hallmark features include **lockjaw**, **risus sardonicus** (sardonic smile), and **opisthotonus**, with intact sensorium (no loss of consciousness or sensation). Management is a medical emergency: immediately begin wound debridement and antibiotics (to stop toxin production), administer **TIG** (to neutralize circulating toxin), control spasms with benzodiazepines (and reduce stimulation), secure the airway (risk of laryngospasm), and give the tetanus toxoid **vaccine** to induce active immunity (infection does not confer immunity)."
