  "definition": "Rare, life‑threatening **shock syndrome** caused by superantigen‑producing **Staph aureus** (TSST‑1 toxin) or **Strep pyogenes** (Spe exotoxins). Characterized by sudden high fever, hypotension, a diffuse **erythroderma** (sunburn‑like rash with later desquamation), and rapid multi‑organ failure.",
  "why_it_matters": "Rapidly fatal if unrecognized (mortality can exceed 30% in streptococcal cases). Classic exam scenario linking **tampon** use or post‑surgical wounds to shock and rash. Requires urgent source control and ICU care to prevent death.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Menstruation-associated (Staph) TSS: classically a young woman using **tampons** → abrupt onset high fever (≥39 °C), headache, **vomiting/diarrhea**, diffuse sunburn-like rash, conjunctival injection, and hypotension.",
    "Non-menstrual TSS: any skin or soft-tissue infection (nasal packing, postpartum infection, surgical wound, burn) can serve as a source → similar presentation of fever + rash + shock. Often with mucous membrane hyperemia (\"**strawberry tongue**\"), and rash **desquamates** 1–2 weeks later.",
    "**Streptococcal TSS** (STSS) typically follows invasive GAS infection (e.g., necrotizing fasciitis or toxic strep cellulitis). Presents with severe localized pain, rapidly progressive infection, and early shock; blood cultures are often positive for GAS (unlike Staph TSS)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Immediately perform **source control**: remove any retained foreign body (tampon, nasal packing) and drain or surgically debride any infected wound or necrotic tissue.",
    "Supportive care for **shock**: aggressive IV fluids, oxygen, and vasopressors as needed; monitor in ICU for multiorgan dysfunction (renal failure, ARDS, DIC, etc.).",
    "Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics: cover MRSA and GAS (e.g., **vancomycin** + **clindamycin**; add gram-negative coverage like piperacillin-tazobactam if polymicrobial infection is suspected). **Clindamycin** is crucial to inhibit toxin production.",
    "Confirm diagnosis by CDC criteria (fever, rash, hypotension plus ≥3 organ systems involved). Streptococcal TSS is confirmed by isolation of GAS (usually from a sterile site). Do not wait for cultures—treat immediately if TSS is suspected."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "id": "kawasaki-disease",
      "hint": "pediatric vasculitis (fever >5 days, rash, conjunctivitis, 'strawberry tongue'); occurs in children and **no hypotension**"

      "id": "septic-shock",
      "name": "Septic shock (other causes)",
      "hint": "shock from other severe infections (e.g., meningococcemia); typically lacks the diffuse erythroderma and desquamation seen in TSS"
    },
    {
      "id": "disseminated-intravascular-coagulation",
      "hint": "consumptive coagulopathy often present in TSS; consider other DIC triggers (sepsis, obstetric emergency, malignancy)"

  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: **TSS = Tampons → Staph → Shock** (classic context for staphylococcal TSS in exams).",
    "TSS rash looks like a **sunburn** and later **peels** on palms/soles. Also remember **strawberry tongue** (as seen in scarlet fever and Kawasaki) — shock differentiates TSS."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Young woman on her period (tampon use) with sudden fever >102 °F, hypotension, vomiting, and a diffuse erythematous rash → **Staphylococcal TSS** (TSST‑1 from S. aureus).",
    "Patient with rapidly spreading soft-tissue infection (necrotizing fasciitis) who develops severe pain, hypotension, and multi‑organ failure → **Streptococcal TSS** (GAS invasive infection)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Resuscitation**: IV fluids (crystalloids) and support of blood pressure (add **norepinephrine** or other vasopressors if needed); ICU-level monitoring.",
    "**Remove the source**: promptly take out tampons, vaginal diaphragms, nasal packing; obtain surgical consult for debridement of any necrotic infection (e.g., necrotizing fasciitis).",
    "**Empiric antibiotics**: start broad IV coverage (e.g., **vancomycin** + **clindamycin**, plus a beta-lactam for gram-negatives if indicated) after obtaining cultures. Clindamycin helps suppress toxin production.",
    "Tailor therapy once organism is identified: for GAS, use **penicillin G + clindamycin**; for MSSA, use nafcillin (or oxacillin) + clindamycin. Treat for about 10–14 days total.",
    "Consider **IVIG** (2 g/kg) as adjunct therapy in severe cases refractory to fluids and vasopressors, to help neutralize circulating toxins."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "High fever, diffuse rash, and hypotension in a menstruating patient → suspect TSS immediately (remove **tampon** and begin empiric treatment).",
    "Severe pain out of proportion in a limb wound or postpartum infection with rapid progression to shock → consider **GAS** necrotizing infection causing TSS (emergency surgical intervention needed)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Shock with rash → suspect TSS; begin IV fluids, draw labs/cultures, and **remove any foreign body** (tampon, packing) immediately.",
    "Start broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin + clindamycin ± gram-negative coverage) **without delay**; send cultures from blood and infection sites.",
    "Admit to ICU for invasive monitoring and supportive care; evaluate for organ failures (dialysis for kidney failure, mechanical ventilation for ARDS, correct coagulopathy, etc.).",
    "If **GAS** is confirmed, switch to penicillin G plus clindamycin; pursue prompt surgical debridement of infected tissue (source control).",
    "Add IVIG for patients in persistent shock despite fluids and vasopressors. Continue intensive supportive care until hemodynamically stable."
