  "definition": "Infection caused by the protozoan *Toxoplasma gondii*. Typically asymptomatic in healthy people, but in immunocompromised patients it causes life‑threatening encephalitis (multiple brain abscesses), and in utero infection leads to the classic triad of chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and intracranial calcifications.",
