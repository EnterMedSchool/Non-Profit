  "definition": "A group of **congenital infections** in pregnancy that are often benign or mild in the mother but **cause serious fetal harm**. The TORCH acronym stands for **Toxoplasmosis, \"Other\" (various infections like syphilis, varicella, parvovirus), Rubella, CMV, HSV**.",
  "why_it_matters": "TORCH infections can lead to **miscarriages, stillbirths, or severe birth defects** if acquired in utero. For example, maternal rubella in early pregnancy carries ~85% risk of congenital rubella syndrome (deafness, cataracts, heart defects). **CMV is the most common infectious cause of birth defects** and congenital hearing loss, while congenital syphilis remains a leading preventable cause of stillbirth. Early identification and prevention (e.g. vaccination, prenatal screening) are critical to reduce fetal morbidity.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "**Mothers** often have **no or mild symptoms** (e.g. low-grade fever, rash, lymphadenopathy) and may not realize they're infected. **Fetuses/Newborns** commonly show growth restriction, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and purpura (a 'blueberry muffin' rash from extramedullary hematopoiesis).",
    "Each infection has unique clues: **Toxoplasmosis** – classically causes a triad of **chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and diffuse intracranial calcifications**. **Syphilis** – often presents with **snuffles** (bloody nasal discharge), rash on palms/soles, skeletal abnormalities, and later deafness, Hutchinson teeth, saddle nose. **Varicella-Zoster** – early pregnancy infection can lead to **limb hypoplasia, skin scarring, and eye damage** (congenital varicella syndrome). **Parvovirus B19** – causes **fetal anemia** and hydrops (no structural defects).",
    "**Rubella** – leads to the classic triad of **sensorineural deafness, cataracts, and cardiac defects** (e.g. PDA) along with 'blueberry muffin' purpuric rash. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV)** – the most common, often causes **sensorineural hearing loss**, periventricular calcifications, **microcephaly**, chorioretinitis, petechiae, and blueberry muffin rash. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)** – usually transmitted at birth (active genital lesions); newborn may develop **vesicular lesions, encephalitis, or disseminated infection** in the first weeks of life."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Maintain a high index of suspicion if a pregnant patient has a **compatible exposure or illness** (e.g. cat litter for toxo, unvaccinated with rash contact for rubella, new STI for syphilis) or if ultrasound detects **hydrops, calcifications, or IUGR**.",
    "If a TORCH infection is suspected, perform **maternal serologies (IgM/IgG)** specific to the pathogen. Maternal IgM seroconversion indicates a recent infection; confirm with additional tests (e.g. treponemal test for syphilis, avidity testing for toxo).",
    "Consider **amniocentesis with PCR** to confirm fetal infection (e.g. PCR of amniotic fluid at ~18 weeks for Toxoplasma or CMV), especially if maternal infection occurred in early pregnancy.",
    "Offer targeted **ultrasound** and fetal monitoring when maternal infection is known – look for structural anomalies (brain calcifications, hydrops, cardiac defects). In some cases (e.g. fetal anemia from parvovirus), intrauterine interventions like transfusion may be indicated.",
    "At delivery, evaluate the neonate with **PCR or serologic tests** (e.g. infant urine or saliva PCR for CMV within 2–3 weeks, RPR/VDRL for syphilis, viral culture/PCR for HSV) and start empirical treatment if signs are present (e.g. IV acyclovir for suspected neonatal HSV, penicillin for syphilis)."

  "tricks": [
    "Remember **TORCH**: **Toxo**, **Other** (Syphilis, VZV, Parvo, etc.), **Rubella**, **CMV**, **HSV**. Always consider \"Other\" to include **syphilis** (most common) and others like varicella, parvovirus B19, Zika, HIV.",
    "A **'blueberry muffin' rash** (purple papular spots in a neonate) suggests **dermal extramedullary hematopoiesis** – classically seen in congenital **rubella** or **CMV**, but can occur in other TORCH infections.",
    "**Congenital infections are the #1 cause of sensorineural hearing loss** in children – especially CMV and rubella. Always test hearing in infants with TORCH infections."

    "Unvaccinated mother with a mild rash and postauricular lymphadenopathy in early pregnancy → infant with **deafness, cataracts, PDA murmur, and 'blueberry muffin' rash** = **Congenital Rubella Syndrome**.",
    "Infant with **chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and diffuse intracranial calcifications** (± macrocephaly and seizures) → **Congenital Toxoplasmosis** (classic triad).",
    "Newborn with **petechiae (blueberry muffin lesions)**, **periventricular** calcifications on neuroimaging, and **sensorineural hearing loss** → **Congenital CMV infection**.",
    "Snuffles (copious nasal discharge) and a **desquamating rash on palms and soles** in a neonate → **Congenital Syphilis** (early finding, even before late stigmata like saddle nose or Hutchinson teeth)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Prevention is paramount: ensure maternal **rubella immunity** (MMR vaccine before pregnancy) and routine **prenatal screening** for infections (e.g. syphilis RPR, HIV, HBV) with prompt treatment if positive. Avoid known exposures (e.g. cats/undercooked meat for toxo, sick kids for CMV).",
    "**Toxoplasmosis** – If acute infection in pregnancy, start **spiramycin** ASAP (especially in first 18 weeks) to reduce fetal transmission. If fetal infection is confirmed or infection occurs >18 weeks, switch to **pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine + leucovorin** (after 1st trimester). Treat congenitally infected newborns with the same combo for 12 months.",
    "**Syphilis** – Treat the mother (and her partner) immediately with **IM penicillin G**, which prevents >90% of congenital syphilis cases. Infants with confirmed or probable congenital syphilis also receive penicillin (10 days IV). Adequate maternal therapy greatly reduces fetal harm.",
    "**CMV** – No vaccine or proven antenatal treatment exists. For symptomatic congenital CMV, start **valganciclovir** by 1 month of age and continue for 6 months, which can improve hearing and developmental outcomes.",
    "**HSV** – Mothers with genital HSV should receive **acyclovir suppression** from 36 weeks and deliver via **C-section if active lesions** to prevent neonatal herpes. Infants with neonatal HSV infection require aggressive treatment with high-dose **IV acyclovir** (14–21 days) to reduce mortality.",
    "**Others** – **Varicella-Zoster**: if a pregnant mother is exposed and non-immune, give varicella **immune globulin**; neonatal varicella is treated with **acyclovir**. **Parvovirus B19**: no specific antiviral – manage fetal hydrops (e.g. intrauterine transfusions) and support the neonate as needed."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Pregnant patient with a **febrile rash or mononucleosis-like illness** (especially if not immune/vaccinated) → prompt TORCH evaluation. Early pregnancy infections (first trimester) carry the highest teratogenic risk.",
    "**Ultrasound clues** like **hydrops fetalis** (fluid in fetal compartments), **intracranial calcifications**, or unexplained **IUGR** should prompt work-up for congenital infection. Do not attribute such findings solely to genetic causes without ruling out TORCH."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "📋 **Pre-pregnancy:** Screen & vaccinate. Ensure women of childbearing age are **immune to rubella** (vaccinate ≥1 month pre-conception). Counsel on avoiding infections (e.g. hand hygiene to prevent CMV from toddlers, avoid cat litter for toxo).",
    "📋 **Initial prenatal visit:** Perform routine **TORCH screening where indicated** – e.g. serologic tests for syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B, and check rubella immunity. (Note: Universal toxo or CMV screening isn't done in many regions unless risk factors are present.)",
    "📋 **If maternal infection suspected:** Do targeted **IgM/IgG testing** for the suspected pathogen. For viruses like CMV or Zika, consider **PCR** on maternal blood or amniotic fluid. Offer high-resolution **ultrasound** to check for fetal anomalies related to infection.",
    "📋 **Confirm diagnosis:** Options include **amniocentesis for PCR** (e.g. amniotic fluid CMV PCR) or specialized tests (e.g. fetal blood sampling for anemia in parvovirus). Engage maternal-fetal medicine and infectious disease specialists for confirmed infections.",
    "📋 **Delivery & neonatal care:** If a TORCH infection was known or suspected, plan for appropriate neonatal evaluation. Test the newborn (e.g. PCR of urine for CMV within 3 weeks, infant RPR for syphilis) and start **empiric therapy** (e.g. acyclovir for possible HSV, penicillin for syphilis) without delay if clinical signs are present."
