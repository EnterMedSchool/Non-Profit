  "definition": "Acute infection by toxin-producing **Corynebacterium diphtheriae** affecting the respiratory tract (or skin). It causes a tough **pseudomembrane** on mucous membranes and can lead to life-threatening systemic toxin effects (notably **myocarditis** and neuropathy).",
  "why_it_matters": "Often fatal if untreated (up to ~30% in unvaccinated). Historically a major childhood killer before vaccines, it is now rare but outbreaks occur with low immunization coverage. Rapid recognition and **antitoxin** treatment are critical, making diphtheria a classic exam topic in infectious disease and public health.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Classic **respiratory diphtheria** – Unimmunized patient with a gradually worsening sore throat, low-grade fever, and a **gray, adherent pseudomembrane** on the tonsils/pharynx. Neck swelling (**bull neck**) from cervical lymphadenopathy and edema is seen in severe cases, and airway obstruction (stridor) can occur.",
    "**Cutaneous diphtheria** – Infection of the skin at a wound or ulcer, causing a chronic, non-healing **ulcer** with a dirty gray membrane. Typically seen in unhygienic or immunocompromised settings; usually localized with mild systemic symptoms.",
    "**Systemic complications** – After a few days to weeks, the diphtheria **exotoxin** can disseminate and damage distant organs. Look for **myocarditis** (arrhythmias, heart failure) and **peripheral neuropathy** (e.g. **palatal paralysis**, cranial nerve palsies) in severe cases."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "If diphtheria is suspected, **do not wait** for lab confirmation – begin antitoxin therapy right away.",
    "Obtain swabs from the throat (or wound) **before starting antibiotics** for culture on special media (e.g., cystine-tellurite agar shows characteristic black colonies of *C. diphtheriae*).",
    "Confirm toxigenicity of the isolate with the **Elek test** (in vitro toxin assay) or PCR for the toxin gene.",
    "A firmly attached **gray membrane** in the throat that **bleeds** when scraped is a diagnostic clue pointing to diphtheria."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "name": "Streptococcal pharyngitis",
      "hint": "exudative tonsillitis (white patches), high fever, tender nodes, but **no pseudomembrane or toxin**"
    },
    {
      "name": "Epiglottitis",
      "hint": "acute onset, **drooling**, stridor, \"thumbprint\" sign on x-ray; no pharyngeal membrane (infection of epiglottis, often *Hib*)"
    },
    {
      "name": "Oral candidiasis (thrush)",
      "hint": "white plaques in mouth/throat that **scrape off easily**; common in infants or immunocompromised patients"
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Gray **pseudomembrane** firmly adherent to the throat and bleeding if scraped = hallmark of diphtheria (unlike thrush, which is easily removable).",
    "**Bull neck** describes the massive neck swelling in severe diphtheria due to lymphadenopathy and edema.",
    "Mnemonic **ABCDEFG** for diphtheria toxin – **A**DP-ribosylation (of EF-2) by **B**eta-prophage gene in **C**orynebacterium **D**iphtheriae leads to **E**longation **F**actor-2 inhibition and **G**ranules (blue-red metachromatic granules on Löffler medium)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Unvaccinated child with fever, sore throat, a **gray leathery membrane** on the tonsils, and neck swelling (bull neck) → Diphtheria (respiratory infection).",
    "Patient recovering from a severe throat infection now develops arrhythmia and heart failure → **myocarditis** from diphtheria toxin.",
    "Homeless patient with a chronic non-healing leg ulcer covered by a gray membrane but minimal systemic illness → **cutaneous diphtheria**."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Diphtheria antitoxin** (horse serum) – administer immediately if diphtheria is suspected (neutralizes circulating toxin; perform a test dose to check for hypersensitivity).",
    "**Antibiotics** – give erythromycin (preferred) or intramuscular penicillin G for ~14 days to eradicate *C. diphtheriae* (also give antibiotic prophylaxis to close contacts).",
    "**Isolation & notification** – isolate the patient under droplet precautions until 2 consecutive cultures (after antibiotics) are negative; notify public health authorities to facilitate contact tracing and quarantine.",
    "**Supportive care** – secure the airway (pseudomembranes may require careful endoscopic removal if causing obstruction) and monitor in ICU for cardiac arrhythmias or respiratory failure. After recovery, ensure the patient is **vaccinated** (infection does not confer reliable immunity)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Extensive **bull neck** swelling with stridor or respiratory distress – indicates impending airway obstruction (emergency intervention needed).",
    "Evidence of **toxin spread**: new-onset arrhythmias, heart block or heart failure (myocarditis), or cranial nerve palsies and paralysis (neuritis) – signal severe diphtheria (high mortality, ICU care needed)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Unvaccinated person with sore throat + pseudomembrane → **suspect diphtheria** (clinical diagnosis).",
    "If suspected, **administer antitoxin immediately** – do not wait for lab results.",
    "Secure airway as needed; obtain throat (or lesion) swabs for culture and toxin testing (Elek test or PCR).",
    "Start **antibiotics** (erythromycin or penicillin) and maintain **droplet isolation** precautions.",
    "Report the case to public health; give close contacts prophylactic antibiotics and booster vaccine; once recovered, update the patient's diphtheria immunizations."
