  "definition": "Indolent **B-cell leukemia** of older adults, characterized by chronic lymphocytosis and immune dysfunction. **Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)** is the term for the same clonal malignancy when it presents primarily in lymph nodes rather than blood.",
  "why_it_matters": "Most common adult leukemia in Western countries. Frequently encountered as an incidental lymphocytosis, yet important for its classic exam hallmarks (e.g., **smudge cells**) and unique management (often observation until progression). Also notable for potential transformation to an aggressive lymphoma (Richter syndrome).",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Often **asymptomatic** at diagnosis; routine labs may show very high **WBC** (e.g., >50,000) with lymphocytosis. Physical exam can be unremarkable or reveal painless lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.",
    "Typical patient is **elderly** (median age ~65–70). Some patients develop nonspecific symptoms like fatigue or weight loss. **B symptoms** (fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss) are usually absent until advanced disease or transformation.",
    "**Recurrent infections** are common later due to **hypogammaglobulinemia** (impaired immunoglobulin production). Autoimmune complications can occur (e.g., warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Confirm the diagnosis with **flow cytometry** of peripheral blood showing a clonal B-cell population co-expressing **CD5** and **CD23** (characteristic immunophenotype of CLL).",
    "Stage the disease (e.g., **Rai** or **Binet** systems): early stage (lymphocytosis only) vs. advanced (extensive lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, anemia or thrombocytopenia). Staging guides prognosis but not treatment decisions.",
    "Assess prognostic markers: perform FISH for cytogenetics (e.g., del(13q) is favorable, while **del(17p)** or TP53 mutation portends poor prognosis) and determine **IGHV** mutation status (mutated IGHV = more indolent disease).",
    "Treatment is indicated only for **active disease** (e.g., significant symptoms, rapidly progressive lymphocytosis, bulky lymphadenopathy, or cytopenias from marrow infiltration). **Watchful waiting** is standard for low-risk, asymptomatic CLL.",
    "If treatment is needed, targeted therapies are first-line (see **Treatment** below). Also address supportive care: e.g., periodic IVIG infusions for severe hypogammaglobulinemia with infections, and manage autoimmune hemolysis with steroids."

  "differentials": [
    {
      "id": "mantle-cell-lymphoma",
      "hint": "Older male, CD5+ **but CD23–**; involves GI tract (e.g., bowel polyps); driven by **t(11;14)** cyclin D1 overexpression; more aggressive course"
    },
    {
      "id": "hairy-cell-leukemia",
      "hint": "Middle-aged man with massive splenomegaly and pancytopenia; lymphocytes with cytoplasmic 'hairy' projections; **TRAP** positive, BRAF mutation"

    {
      "name": "Reactive (infectious) lymphocytosis",
      "hint": "Polyclonal lymphocyte expansion (e.g., EBV mononucleosis, viral infections); usually self-limited and lacks clonal markers"
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: **CLL = Crushed Little Lymphocytes** – referring to the classic **smudge cells** (fragile lymphocytes broken during smear preparation).",
    "CLL/SLL cells aberrantly co-express **CD5** (normally a T-cell antigen) along with B-cell markers (CD19, CD20) and **CD23** – a key immunophenotypic clue distinguishing CLL from other leukemias/lymphomas.",
    "Cytogenetics predict prognosis: **del(13q)** is most common and confers a favorable outcome, whereas **del(17p)** (loss of TP53) is associated with chemotherapy resistance and worse prognosis."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Older adult with a very high WBC count (e.g., 100,000) composed mostly of lymphocytes and many smudge cells on peripheral smear → Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (often asymptomatic at presentation).",
    "Patient with known CLL who develops sudden B symptoms (fevers, night sweats, weight loss) and rapid growth of a single lymph node → suspect **Richter transformation** (CLL evolving into an aggressive large B-cell lymphoma)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Early-stage or low-risk CLL (e.g., Rai stage 0) is managed with **observation** (\"watch and wait\") – no treatment unless the disease progresses or symptoms appear.",
    "For active or advanced disease, first-line therapy involves targeted agents rather than traditional chemo. **Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors** like **ibrutinib** or **acalabrutinib**, or the **BCL-2 inhibitor** **venetoclax**, are used often in combination with an anti-**CD20** monoclonal antibody (e.g., **rituximab** or **obinutuzumab**).",
    "Intensive chemoimmunotherapy (e.g., **FCR** regimen – fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab) can induce remissions in fit younger patients (particularly with IGHV-mutated disease) but is now largely supplanted by targeted therapies due to better safety and outcomes.",
    "Manage complications: e.g., autoimmune hemolytic anemia is treated with corticosteroids; severe infections may warrant IVIG; consider allogeneic stem cell transplant or CAR T-cell therapy in refractory CLL cases."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "New-onset **B symptoms** (fever, drenching night sweats, weight loss) or a rapidly enlarging lymph node in a CLL patient – raises concern for **Richter transformation** to an aggressive lymphoma.",
    "Unexplained rapid drop in hemoglobin in CLL → evaluate for **autoimmune hemolytic anemia** (Coombs-positive hemolysis, which CLL can trigger) and treat promptly (e.g., steroids)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Unexplained lymphocytosis (especially in an older adult) or persistent lymphadenopathy → **suspect CLL**.",
    "Confirm CLL with **flow cytometry** on blood showing clonal B cells (CD19+) with co-expression of **CD5** and **CD23**.",
    "Evaluate disease extent: thorough exam for lymph nodes and organomegaly; use **Rai/Binet staging** to stratify risk (e.g., lymphocytosis only vs. lymphadenopathy vs. anemia/thrombocytopenia).",
    "If early stage and asymptomatic → **observe** (no immediate treatment, regular follow-up).",
    "If **symptomatic or advanced** (bulky nodes, cytopenias, or symptoms) → **treat** with appropriate therapy (targeted agents ± anti-CD20 antibody)."
