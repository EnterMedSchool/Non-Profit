  "definition": "Abnormally high white blood cell count (typically >11,000/µL in adults).",
  "why_it_matters": "Alerts clinicians to underlying conditions (infection, inflammation, stress, or leukemia). Also, extremely high WBC counts can cause **hyperviscosity** (leukostasis) and often signify serious pathology.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Infection/inflammation: e.g. pneumonia or appendicitis with **fever** and WBC 15–25k (neutrophil predominance, left shift). **Severe infections** (sepsis, *C. diff* colitis) can cause WBC >50k (leukemoid reaction).",
    "Hematologic malignancy: chronic leukemias (CML, CLL) often have very high WBC (e.g. >50–100k); patients may have **splenomegaly**, **B symptoms** (weight loss, night sweats) or be asymptomatic (incidental finding).",
    "Medications/stress: **corticosteroids** (e.g. prednisone) cause neutrophil demargination leading to leukocytosis (typically 12–18k) without infection; intense stress (trauma, exercise) or **epinephrine** can transiently elevate WBC."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Interpret WBC with **differential**: identify which cell type is elevated (neutrophilia suggests bacterial infection or CML; lymphocytosis suggests viral infection or CLL; eosinophilia points to allergy/parasites, etc.).",
    "Review the **peripheral smear**: the presence of **blasts** or very immature cells strongly suggests leukemia (not reactive); **toxic granulation** or Döhle bodies in neutrophils support infection.",
    "If neutrophil count is markedly high with no obvious cause, check **leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP)** score: high in reactive leukemoid reactions, but low in CML. CML often also has increased **basophils**.",
    "For suspected leukemia, pursue definitive tests: e.g. send molecular test for **BCR-ABL** (Philadelphia chromosome) in suspected CML, and perform bone marrow biopsy with **flow cytometry** to confirm malignancy."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "name": "Leukemoid reaction",
      "hint": "reactive neutrophilic leukocytosis (often >50k) from severe infection/inflammation; high LAP, no clonal markers"

      "id": "chronic-myeloid-leukemia",
      "abbr": [
        "CML"

    },
    {
      "name": "Infection or inflammation",
      "hint": "common cause of mild–moderate leukocytosis (e.g. bacterial pneumonia, appendicitis); usually WBC <30k and normalizes after illness"
    },
    {
      "name": "Corticosteroid effect",
      "hint": "drug-induced neutrophilia (demargination); moderate WBC elevation without infection"
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "**LAP** score mnemonic: Leukemoid = **LAP high**, Leukemia (CML) = LAP low.",
    "Steroids cause neutrophils to **demarginate** (detach from blood vessel walls), raising the circulating WBC count without new cell production."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Patient with severe *C. difficile* colitis, WBC 55,000 (neutrophils with bands), high LAP score → **Leukemoid reaction** due to infection.",
    "Middle-aged adult with 100,000 WBC, left-shifted neutrophils + basophils, massive splenomegaly, low LAP → **Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)**.",
    "Asthma patient on high-dose prednisone with WBC 16,000 (mostly neutrophils, no fever or infection) → **Steroid-induced leukocytosis**."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Benign/reactive leukocytosis requires treating the **underlying cause**: e.g. antibiotics for infection, management of inflammation; the WBC count will normalize with resolution.",
    "If drug-induced (e.g. steroid therapy), reduce or discontinue the offending **medication** if clinically appropriate.",
    "Malignant leukocytosis (leukemia) warrants specific therapy for that leukemia (e.g. **tyrosine kinase inhibitor** such as imatinib for CML, or chemotherapy for acute leukemia).",
    "If WBC is >100k with signs of **leukostasis** (dyspnea, neurologic deficits), initiate urgent measures to rapidly lower the count (e.g. IV **hydroxyurea**, leukapheresis)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Blasts** on peripheral smear (any significant blast presence) → highly suggestive of acute leukemia (requires immediate evaluation).",
    "Extremely elevated WBC (e.g. >100,000/µL) with **dyspnea, headache, or confusion** → think hyperviscosity syndrome (leukostasis) — a medical emergency.",
    "Leukocytosis accompanied by **anemia, thrombocytopenia, or organomegaly** (splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy) → concerning for leukemia or bone marrow disorder rather than a benign reaction."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "↑WBC on lab → repeat **CBC + differential** to confirm and identify which lineage is elevated.",
    "Clinical assessment → look for infection (fever, source), inflammation, stress or medications that could explain a reactive leukocytosis.",
    "If neutrophilia with no clear cause → obtain a **LAP score** (high = reactive, low = CML) and consider molecular testing for **BCR-ABL**; treat any hidden infection if suspected.",
    "If lymphocytosis → test for acute infection (e.g. EBV serologies); if persistent or extreme, get **flow cytometry** on blood to evaluate for clonal lymphoproliferative disorder (e.g. CLL).",
    "No obvious benign cause or abnormal cells present → refer to hematology for bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic studies to rule out leukemia."

      "answer": "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)",
      "teaching": "CML (a myeloproliferative leukemia) causes unregulated neutrophil proliferation (WBC often >100k). The presence of basophilia and BCR-ABL fusion (Philadelphia chromosome) confirms CML, which is distinguished from a reactive leukocytosis by low LAP score. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors has dramatically improved CML outcomes."
