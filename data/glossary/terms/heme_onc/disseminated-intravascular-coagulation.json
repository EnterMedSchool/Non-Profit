    "Acutely ill patient with bleeding from venipuncture/lines, ecchymoses, or oozing wounds.",
    "Common precipitants: **sepsis (especially gram‑negative)**, **obstetric emergencies** (placental abruption, amniotic fluid embolism, retained dead fetus), **trauma**, **malignancy** (esp. acute promyelocytic leukemia), **severe pancreatitis**, **snakebite**, **massive transfusion**.",

    "If thrombosis predominates and bleeding is controlled, **heparin** can be considered case‑by‑case.",
    "Differentiate from liver disease: factor VIII is consumed in DIC (low), whereas it’s normal/high in liver failure."
