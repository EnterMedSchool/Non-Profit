  "definition": "Rare paraneoplastic syndrome caused by metastatic **serotonin**-secreting neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoids), typically of midgut origin with liver metastases, leading to episodic flushing, secretory diarrhea, bronchospasm, and fibrotic right-sided heart valve lesions.",
  "why_it_matters": "Though uncommon, carcinoid syndrome is a classic cause of unexplained flushing and diarrhea. Its presence usually signifies advanced malignancy (often already with liver metastases) and can lead to serious complications like **carcinoid heart disease** (cause of morbidity) and **niacin deficiency**. Early recognition allows for appropriate imaging, somatostatin analog therapy, and possible tumor resection to improve outcomes.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Episodic cutaneous **flushing** of the face/neck (red to violaceous); often triggered by stress, alcohol, or certain foods.",
    "**Diarrhea** (intermittent, secretory) with abdominal cramping; can lead to electrolyte disturbances and weight loss.",
    "**Bronchospasm** causing wheezing and dyspnea (asthma-like episodes), often accompanying flushing.",
    "Fibrosis of the right heart valves (due to serotonin) causing **tricuspid regurgitation** and **pulmonary stenosis** (jugular venous distension, edema); left heart is typically spared (lung metabolism of serotonin).",
    "Advanced cases: **pellagra** (dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia from niacin deficiency) due to tryptophan being diverted to serotonin."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Biochemical confirmation: 24-hour urinary **5-HIAA** (serotonin metabolite) is the best initial test (avoid serotonin-rich foods before test); plasma 5-HIAA or serum **chromogranin A** can be supportive.",
    "Localize the tumor: imaging with contrast **CT/MRI** of the abdomen and somatostatin receptor nuclear scan (octreotide scan or **<sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE** PET) to identify primary lesion and metastases.",
    "Evaluate extent and complications: perform **echocardiography** to assess carcinoid heart disease if murmurs or symptoms; check vitamin **B3** levels if pellagra signs are present.",
    "Avoid triggers: counsel on avoiding alcohol and triggering foods (e.g., red wine, chocolate, nuts, cheese) that can precipitate flushing.",
    "Peri-procedural care: administer prophylactic **octreotide** before anesthesia or invasive procedures to prevent a carcinoid crisis (massive hormone release causing shock)."

    "Patient with a history of carcinoid tumor develops a photosensitive rash, glossitis, diarrhea, and mental status changes → niacin deficiency (**pellagra**) due to carcinoid syndrome."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Acute carcinoid **crisis** (severe flushing, bronchospasm, hypotension): prompt IV **octreotide** to abort the episode, plus supportive care (fluids, airway support, antihistamines/bronchodilators).",
    "Chronic management: long-acting **somatostatin analogs** (octreotide, lanreotide) to control hormone secretion and relieve symptoms; add oral **telotristat** (tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor) if diarrhea remains severe.",
    "Surgical therapy: resection of primary tumor and metastases when feasible (e.g., remove bowel tumor, hepatic metastasectomy or embolization) offers best chance at symptom control.",
    "Advanced/metastatic disease: consider **PRRT** (peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with Lutetium-177) for somatostatin receptor–positive tumors; targeted therapies (e.g., everolimus) or interferon-alpha in select cases. Manage complications: replace niacin, and perform valve surgery if heart failure is advanced."

  "red_flags": [
    "Profound flushing, bronchospasm, and hypotension during surgery or biopsy in a NET patient = **carcinoid crisis** – require emergent octreotide, IV fluids, and pressors to prevent cardiovascular collapse.",
    "Signs of right-sided heart failure (worsening edema, ascites, neck vein distension) in a carcinoid patient – suggests progressing **carcinoid heart disease**; urgent cardiac evaluation (echo) and consideration of valve replacement."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Episodic flushing + diarrhea + wheezing → suspect carcinoid syndrome.",
    "Obtain 24h **urine 5-HIAA** test (confirm excess serotonin).",
    "If 5-HIAA is elevated → perform imaging (CT/MRI) + somatostatin receptor scan to locate tumor and metastases.",
    "Begin **octreotide** to control symptoms; refer to oncology/surgery for tumor-directed therapy (resection if localized, etc.).",
    "For any invasive procedure or if high risk, give prophylactic octreotide to prevent crisis; provide niacin supplementation if needed; periodic echocardiograms to monitor heart."
