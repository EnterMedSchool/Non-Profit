  "definition": "A congenital hindbrain malformation with caudal displacement of the cerebellar vermis/tonsils, brainstem, and fourth ventricle through the foramen magnum due to a small posterior fossa. It is almost always associated with a lumbosacral myelomeningocele and frequently with hydrocephalus; classic MRI features include medullary kinking, beaked tectum (tectal beaking), low tentorium, and a crowded posterior fossa.",
  "why_it_matters": "CM‑II drives much of the morbidity in open spina bifida: neonatal respiratory/feeding problems from brainstem compression, frequent hydrocephalus needing CSF diversion, and long‑term motor/sensory deficits. Prenatal recognition changes counseling and eligibility for fetal myelomeningocele repair, which reduces shunt need and improves motor outcomes.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Prenatal ultrasound: cranial markers of open spina bifida—'lemon sign' (frontal bone scalloping, common ≤24 weeks) and 'banana sign' (curved, small cerebellum/obliterated cisterna magna); often ventriculomegaly.",
    "Neonate/infant with myelomeningocele plus signs of hydrocephalus (rapid head growth, bulging fontanelle, vomiting, sunsetting eyes).",
    "Brainstem dysfunction: stridor, central apnea, bradycardia, poor suck/swallow, aspiration, weak cry, vocal cord paralysis; upper‑extremity weakness/spasticity, nystagmus.",
    "MRI head/spine: small posterior fossa, downward herniation of vermis/tonsils & brainstem, medullary kinking, tectal beaking, low‑lying tentorium/torcula; associated supratentorial anomalies (e.g., corpus callosum dysgenesis) may be present."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "If myelomeningocele is present, assume CM‑II and screen for hydrocephalus (cranial US/MRI).",
    "In a symptomatic infant (apnea/stridor/dysphagia), treat hydrocephalus first (VP shunt or ETV±CPC when appropriate). Hindbrain symptoms often improve after CSF diversion.",
    "Reserve posterior fossa decompression for refractory brainstem compression after adequate CSF diversion or in the rare infant without hydrocephalus who remains symptomatic.",
    "For prenatal diagnosis at specialized centers, discuss MOMS‑criteria fetal repair (typically 19–26 weeks): lowers shunt requirement and lessens hindbrain herniation but carries maternal/fetal risks.",
    "Think about sleep‑disordered breathing (often central) in infants with CM‑II—obtain sleep study if suggestive symptoms or unexplained desaturations.",
    "Always evaluate the whole neuraxis: associated tethered cord, syringomyelia, and orthopedic sequelae are common in spina bifida."
