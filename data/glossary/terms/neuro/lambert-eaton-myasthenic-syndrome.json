  "definition": "Autoimmune disorder of the **neuromuscular junction** (presynaptic) where antibodies target voltage-gated **calcium channels**, reducing **acetylcholine** release. Often a **paraneoplastic** syndrome (≈60% associated with small-cell lung carcinoma).",
  "why_it_matters": "Though rare, recognizing LEMS can lead to early diagnosis of an occult **small cell lung cancer** (LEMS symptoms often precede cancer detection by months). It's also a classic exam topic contrasting LEMS vs **myasthenia gravis**, highlighting LEMS's unique features (e.g. strength improves with use, autonomic involvement).",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Insidious onset of **proximal leg weakness** (difficulty rising from chairs, climbing stairs) that may transiently **improve with exertion** (facilitation).",
    "Marked **hyporeflexia** or absent deep tendon reflexes at rest, which temporarily return after brief exercise (post-exercise facilitation).",
    "**Autonomic** symptoms are common – notably **dry mouth** (often early), plus others like impotence, constipation, and orthostatic lightheadedness.",
    "Minimal **ocular** or bulbar involvement (ptosis or diplopia in <30%, much milder than in MG); **respiratory** muscle weakness is rare."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Confirm diagnosis with electrodiagnostics: repetitive nerve stimulation shows a **>100% increase** in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude after exercise or high-frequency stimulation (incremental response).",
    "Detect **anti–P/Q voltage-gated calcium channel** antibodies in serum (present in ~85–90% of cases) to support the diagnosis.",
    "Always **screen for malignancy**: perform chest imaging (CT scan) to check for **small cell lung carcinoma**; if initial scan is negative, repeat every 6 months for 2 years.",
    "Differentiate from **myasthenia gravis**: LEMS has absent reflexes and autonomic dysfunction, and strength **improves** with use (MG typically has normal reflexes, purely motor fatigue, and worsens with use)."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "id": "myasthenia-gravis",
      "hint": "postsynaptic ACh receptor issue; fatigable weakness **worsens** with use, more ocular findings, normal reflexes"
    },
    {
      "id": "botulism",
      "hint": "acute toxin-mediated presynaptic block; **descending** paralysis with early cranial nerve involvement, autonomic signs (dry mouth, dilated pupils)"
    },
    {
      "name": "Polymyositis",
      "hint": "proximal muscle weakness but a muscle fiber disease (high CK, no NMJ facilitation, normal reflexes, no autonomic symptoms)"
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: **LEMS** – **L**egs (starts in proximal legs), **E**nhanced by Exercise (strength temporarily improves), **M**alignancy (paraneoplastic, often small cell lung CA), **S**pares eyes (ocular signs are mild).",
    "Facilitation phenomenon: brief exercise makes reflexes and strength transiently better – a hallmark of LEMS (contrast with MG)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Older male **smoker** with chronic cough develops progressive proximal weakness that **improves after exercise**, accompanied by **dry mouth** and absent reflexes → Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (paraneoplastic; suspect small cell lung cancer).",
    "Patient treated for \"myasthenia\" shows **hyporeflexia** and **autonomic** symptoms (e.g. dry mouth) – minimal improvement with edrophonium – workup reveals a lung mass → LEMS misdiagnosed as MG (LEMS has autonomic involvement and poor response to Tensilon)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "If an underlying tumor is present, treat the **cancer** (e.g. chemo ± radiation for SCLC) – LEMS symptoms often improve after successful cancer therapy.",
    "Symptomatic therapy: **3,4-diaminopyridine (amifampridine)** – a K⁺ channel blocker that prolongs nerve terminal depolarization and boosts ACh release. **Pyridostigmine** (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) is often added for additional improvement.",
    "**Immunosuppression** can help in non-paraneoplastic or refractory LEMS: corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) and/or azathioprine; also **IVIG** or plasmapheresis for short-term benefit, though LEMS responds less to these than MG."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "LEMS onset in a **>50-year-old smoker** → assume paraneoplastic until proven otherwise. Aggressively search for **small cell lung carcinoma** (initial and repeat scans).",
    "Prolonged paralysis after surgery (excessive response to neuromuscular blockers) can be an early clue to undiagnosed LEMS."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Proximal muscle weakness + autonomic signs (dry mouth, etc.) → **suspect LEMS**.",
    "**Electrodiagnosis**: perform repetitive nerve stimulation EMG (look for high-frequency facilitation) and test for anti-VGCC antibodies to confirm LEMS.",
    "If LEMS confirmed → **screen for SCLC** with chest CT (repeat every 6 mos for 2 years if initial scan is normal).",
    "**Manage**: treat underlying malignancy if present; give 3,4-DAP ± pyridostigmine for symptoms; add immunosuppressive therapy or IVIG if needed."

  "cases": [
    {
      "stem": "A 58‑year‑old man with a 40-pack‑year smoking history has had increasing difficulty climbing stairs over 8 months. He reports a chronically dry mouth. On exam, he has proximal leg weakness (4/5 strength) that **temporarily improves** after exercise, mild ptosis, and absent reflexes (which return after a brief effort). Chest imaging reveals a left hilar mass.",

      "answer": "Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (autoimmune, non-paraneoplastic)",
      "teaching": "This is an example of non-paraneoplastic LEMS. The presentation can mimic myasthenia gravis but with notable differences: autonomic dysfunction (dry mouth, etc.) and hyporeflexia with post-exercise improvement. Anti-VGCC antibodies would confirm the diagnosis. Cancer screening is still warranted initially, but in younger patients LEMS often occurs idiopathically."
