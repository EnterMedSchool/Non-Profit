  "definition": "Mildest form of spina bifida (a neural tube defect) where the bony vertebral arches fail to fuse, leaving a \"hidden\" gap. It results from incomplete neural tube closure (around days 17-30 of gestation) but has no exposed neural tissue.",
  "why_it_matters": "Occulta means \"hidden\" - it's extremely common (10-20% of people) yet usually asymptomatic. It's often discovered incidentally (e.g. on spine X-ray/MRI for another reason) but is a classic high-yield topic. A sacral tuft of hair, dimple, or birthmark is a key exam clue. Most cases are benign, but some patients have tethered cords, so recognition is important.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Often an incidental radiographic finding (e.g. a spine X-ray or MRI done for another reason).",
    "Physical exam may show a sacral skin marker (hairy patch, dermal sinus, lipoma, hemangioma, pigmented nevus, or small dimple).",
    "Neurologic exam is usually normal. If present, symptoms are subtle (mild leg numbness/weakness or occasional back pain)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect SBO when you see a sacral tuft/dimple on exam or an incidental vertebral cleft on imaging.",
    "Screen infants with spinal ultrasound (<6–9 months old) or older kids with MRI to evaluate the spinal cord (look for lipoma or thickened filum).",
    "If imaging is normal and no symptoms, reassure. If cord tethering signs appear, or imaging is abnormal, refer to pediatric neurosurgery."

  "differentials": [
    {
      "id": "meningocele",
      "hint": "Meninges protrude through a spine defect in a CSF-filled sac (no neural tissue) – may cause bladder/bowel issues."
    },
    {
      "id": "myelomeningocele",
      "hint": "Open defect with spinal cord tissue in the sac; open to environment – causes paralysis, sensory loss, and incontinence."
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "\"Occulta\" = hidden - no visible sac. Look for a hairy tuft or midline dimple over the lower spine.",
    "Think \"no meningeal sac\": SBO = vertebral cleft only (absent spinous process) on imaging."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Pelvic X-ray of an asymptomatic teen showing absence of the S1 spinous process (arrow).",
    "Toddler with a sacral tuft/dimple and normal neurology – likely SBO (diagnosed by imaging; just observe if no tethering)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Neurologic findings (leg weakness/numbness, asymmetric reflexes) or orthopedic issues (clubfoot, progressive scoliosis).",
    "Bowel or bladder dysfunction (incontinence/constipation) suggesting tethered cord.",
    "Abnormal findings on spine imaging (e.g. tethered cord, thickened filum, spinal lipoma)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Identify sacral skin markers or incidental spine cleft → if age <6mo do spine ultrasound, if older do MRI.",
    "If imaging shows isolated SBO with normal cord → routine follow-up. If filum thickening/low conus or symptoms → neurosurgery eval.",
    "Remember: most SBO cases don't need surgery unless tethering symptoms develop."
