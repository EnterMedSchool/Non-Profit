  "definition": "Benign Schwann cell tumor of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), usually at the cerebellopontine angle; causes progressive unilateral hearing loss with tinnitus.",
  "why_it_matters": "Most common tumor of the cerebellopontine angle; can cause permanent hearing loss and even brainstem compression if untreated. Also, bilateral acoustic neuromas are a hallmark of **neurofibromatosis type 2**, a classic exam fact.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Gradually progressive **unilateral hearing loss** (sensorineural) and **tinnitus** in one ear are the classic presenting symptoms.",
    "**Imbalance** or unsteady gait (due to vestibular nerve involvement) is common; true spinning vertigo is less frequent.",
    "Large tumors can cause **headaches** and compress nearby nerves – leading to **facial numbness** (trigeminal nerve) or **facial weakness** (facial nerve) – and may even result in **hydrocephalus** (brainstem compression)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect acoustic neuroma in any **unilateral sensorineural hearing loss** or persistent one-sided tinnitus.",
    "Obtain an **audiogram** (hearing test) to confirm asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear.",
    "Confirm the diagnosis with **MRI with gadolinium** of the internal auditory canal (gold standard). If MRI is contraindicated, consider CT with contrast or auditory brainstem response as alternatives.",
    "Consult neurosurgery/otolaryngology for management once diagnosed. Decision between observation, stereotactic radiosurgery, or microsurgical removal depends on tumor size, growth rate, patient age, and hearing status."

      "id": "meningioma",
      "hint": "second most common CPA tumor; dural-based mass that can mimic vestibular schwannoma (often has a dural \"tail\" on MRI)"

  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Bilateral acoustic neuromas = **NF2** (mutation in the *NF2* tumor suppressor gene for merlin on chr22).",
    "Any **unilateral sensorineural hearing loss** should be presumed an acoustic neuroma until proven otherwise—always get MRI."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Middle-aged adult with months of progressive hearing loss and ringing in one ear, along with imbalance; MRI reveals a unilateral cerebellopontine angle tumor → acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma).",
    "Young patient with **Neurofibromatosis type 2** and bilateral hearing loss → bilateral acoustic neuromas (NF2 hallmark)."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Small tumor or minimal symptoms: **observation** with periodic MRI and audiometry (monitor growth).",
    "**Stereotactic radiosurgery** (e.g., Gamma Knife) for moderate tumors or patients unfit for surgery — focused radiation to halt growth while preserving nerves.",
    "Large or growing tumor: **microsurgical resection** (craniotomy) to remove the tumor; offers cure but risks hearing loss or facial nerve injury."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "New **facial paralysis** or facial numbness—indicates tumor enlargement compressing CN VII/V (urgent re-evaluation).",
    "Signs of **↑ICP** (severe headache, vomiting)—suggest hydrocephalus from brainstem compression (neurosurgical emergency)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Unilateral hearing loss or tinnitus → perform audiogram to assess for asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss.",
    "Confirmed asymmetric SNHL → get **MRI (with gadolinium)** of internal auditory canal to look for vestibular schwannoma.",
    "If tumor is detected → refer to specialist and choose management (observe vs radiation vs surgery) based on tumor size and patient factors.",
    "If no tumor is found → pursue other causes of hearing loss (e.g., Meniere disease, chronic noise exposure, otosclerosis)."
