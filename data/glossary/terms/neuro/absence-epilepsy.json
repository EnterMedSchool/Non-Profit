  "definition": "Brief generalized nonconvulsive seizures (formerly **petit mal**) characterized by sudden staring and unresponsiveness for ~10 seconds with immediate recovery; classically associated with a generalized **3 Hz spike‑and‑wave** pattern on EEG.",
  "why_it_matters": "Common pediatric epilepsy syndrome (≈10–17% of childhood epilepsies) often mistaken for daydreaming or **ADHD**. Recognition is crucial, as untreated frequent lapses in awareness can impair learning and pose safety risks. Also frequently tested as a classic presentation of a child \"staring off into space.\"",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Multiple daily episodes of sudden **staring** with unresponsiveness, each lasting ~5–15 seconds and ending abruptly. The child has a **blank stare** (often with subtle eyelid flutter or lip-smacking) and immediately resumes activities with no postictal confusion.",
    "Onset is typically in early school age (around 4–8 years old) in an otherwise normal child. **Hyperventilation** or drowsiness can precipitate seizures (often used as a provocation test in clinic). There is no aura or warning and no after-effects.",
    "In **juvenile absence epilepsy**, absence seizures begin in adolescence (~10–15 years) and occur less frequently but tend to last longer; these patients often eventually have generalized tonic-clonic seizures as well."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Obtain an **EEG** with hyperventilation: typical absence seizures show generalized, symmetric **3 Hz spike-and-wave** discharges that start and stop suddenly, confirming the diagnosis.",
    "Distinguish from non-epileptic staring: during an absence episode, the child is unresponsive to touch or sound and cannot be interrupted (unlike daydreaming). If uncertain, use video-EEG monitoring; most \"staring spells\" in children are actually nonepileptic.",
    "Be alert for **atypical absence**: longer lapses with gradual onset/offset and <2.5 Hz slow spike-waves on EEG suggest a different epilepsy syndrome (e.g., Lennox–Gastaut) and require a different approach.",
    "Neuroimaging is usually normal in idiopathic absence epilepsy and is not indicated in straightforward cases."
  ],
  "differentials": [
    {
      "name": "Inattentiveness/Daydreaming (no seizure)",
      "hint": "Occurs during boredom or fatigue; child can be refocused easily with tactile/verbal stimulation; no true impaired consciousness or abnormal EEG."
    },
    {
      "name": "Focal impaired-awareness seizure",
      "hint": "Previously \"complex partial\" seizure – often >1 minute with an aura and postictal confusion; may have focal automatisms; EEG shows focal onset (e.g., temporal lobe)."
    },
    {
      "name": "Atypical absence seizure",
      "hint": "Longer spells with more gradual onset/termination, EEG <2.5 Hz slow spike-wave; usually in children with intellectual disability or known epilepsy syndrome (e.g., **Lennox-Gastaut**)."
    }
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: It **SUX** to have absence seizures → treat with etho**sux**imide (first-line).",
    "**No postictal** confusion – kids \"snap back\" immediately after an absence ends (unlike other seizures)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Grade-school child with frequent 10-second blank stares in class, unresponsive during episodes, immediately back to normal → **absence seizures** (petit mal).",
    "Teenager with occasional staring spells and a recent generalized tonic-clonic seizure → **juvenile absence epilepsy**."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Ethosuximide** – first-line for typical absence seizures (blocks thalamic T-type Ca²⁺ channels); highly effective for pure absence epilepsy.",
    "**Valproate** – equally effective for absence seizures and preferred if there are generalized tonic-clonic seizures or juvenile onset. Use is limited in young females due to teratogenicity and cognitive side effects.",
    "Others: **Lamotrigine** is a third-line option (some efficacy but lower success rates). **Levetiracetam** or **topiramate** may be used adjunctively. Avoid narrow-spectrum anti-seizure drugs (e.g., **carbamazepine**, **phenytoin**), which can exacerbate absence seizures."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Absence seizures starting <4 years old or with slow irregular spike-waves → consider **atypical absence** (possible Lennox–Gastaut or metabolic etiology) instead of classic absence epilepsy.",
    "Development of other seizure types (e.g., tonic-clonic convulsions) → indicates broader generalized epilepsy (e.g., JAE) and need for broader therapy (valproate) plus safety precautions (no unsupervised swimming, driving restrictions until controlled)."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Child with frequent brief \"staring spells\" → perform hyperventilation in office and order an EEG to evaluate for absence seizures.",
    "If EEG shows generalized 3 Hz spike-and-wave and neurological exam is normal → diagnose **absence epilepsy** (imaging not routinely needed).",
    "Begin **ethosuximide** for typical absence seizures. If seizures are not controlled or if any generalized convulsions occur, switch to or add **valproate** (especially for juvenile onset).",
    "Ensure safety precautions until seizures are controlled (no solo swimming, heights; follow driving laws). Monitor response and side effects; many childhood cases remit at puberty, but some may require long-term therapy."
