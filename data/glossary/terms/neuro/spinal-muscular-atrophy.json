  "definition": "Group of autosomal recessive **motor neuron** disorders (SMN1 gene deletion on 5q) causing degeneration of anterior horn cells and progressive symmetric muscle weakness/atrophy (proximal > distal).",
  "why_it_matters": "SMA is the second most common fatal AR disorder after cystic fibrosis, making it a leading genetic cause of infant mortality. However, newly available therapies (e.g., SMN-enhancing **nusinersen**) can dramatically improve survival if started early.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Type 0 (very rare, congenital): ↓**fetal movements**, **arthrogryposis**, and facial weakness in utero; infant born with severe hypotonia and respiratory failure (usually fatal within months).",
    "Type I (infantile, **Werdnig-Hoffmann**): onset <6 mo with **floppy baby** hypotonia, poor head control, **tongue fasciculations**, weak suck/swallow, and breathing difficulties; without intervention most die <2 yrs.",
    "Type II (intermediate, **Dubowitz**): onset 6–18 mo; infants can **sit** but never stand or walk; symmetric **flaccid weakness** (legs > arms) with absent reflexes; progressive scoliosis and respiratory issues, survival often into young adulthood.",
    "Type III (juvenile, **Kugelberg-Welander**): onset >18 mo (toddler/childhood); **walks** initially but may lose ambulation later; proximal leg weakness (difficulty running, climbing) is most prominent; **no** significant respiratory issues and near-normal life expectancy.",
    "Type IV (adult-onset): onset in the 20s–30s with very **mild** proximal muscle weakness; slow progression and **normal lifespan** (may resemble a pure lower motor neuron form of ALS)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect SMA in an infant with **hypotonia** and areflexia (especially if tongue fasciculations) – confirm diagnosis with **genetic testing** (SMN1 deletion analysis), which is now included in newborn screening.",
    "Differentiate SMA vs muscle disorders: in SMA, **creatine kinase** levels are normal or mildly ↑ (due to neuron loss), whereas muscular dystrophies show very high CK.",
    "Electrodiagnostics (EMG/NCS): normal nerve conduction with diffuse denervation on EMG supports a **motor neuron** process (vs primary muscle or peripheral nerve pathology).",
    "If family history is positive, consider **prenatal testing** (CVS or amniocentesis) to detect SMA in utero."

    },
    {
      "name": "Congenital myopathy",
      "hint": "floppy infant due to intrinsic muscle disorders (e.g., central core, nemaline); often milder or static course; normal or mildly ↑CK"

      "hint": "floppy baby with constipation and cranial nerve palsies (C. botulinum toxin from honey blocks ACh release at NMJ)"

  ],
  "tricks": [
    "More **SMN2** gene copies → milder SMA (extra SMN2 backup genes produce more functional protein).",
    "**Tongue fasciculations** in a floppy infant are a red flag for SMA (LMN lesion)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Infant with **floppy** hypotonia, absent reflexes, feeding difficulty, **tongue fasciculations**, and paradoxical breathing → SMA Type I (Werdnig-Hoffmann).",
    "15‑month‑old who can sit but never walked, now with progressive proximal weakness and developing **scoliosis** → SMA Type II."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Disease-modifying therapies: **Nusinersen** (antisense oligo ↑SMN2-derived protein, intrathecal), **Risdiplam** (oral SMN2 splicing modifier), and **Onasemnogene abeparvovec** (one-time gene replacement) – these can improve motor function, especially if started early.",
    "Supportive care: multidisciplinary support with **PT/OT** (maximize motor function, prevent contractures), respiratory support (e.g., BiPAP or ventilation), and nutritional support (**feeding tube** if risk of aspiration)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "**Respiratory failure** – Paradoxical breathing (bell-shaped chest) or hypoventilation in an SMA infant signals impending failure; initiate ventilatory support immediately.",
    "**Aspiration risk** – Poor **swallowing** and weak cough can cause aspiration pneumonia; provide feeding support (NG/PEG tube) to prevent this."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Positive **newborn screen** or 'floppy' infant → confirm SMA with **SMN1 genetic test**.",
    "If SMA confirmed → promptly begin **SMN-enhancing therapy** (e.g., nusinersen) before significant motor neuron loss occurs.",
    "Initiate comprehensive **supportive care**: pulmonology (respiratory support, airway clearance), nutrition (feeding assistance), orthopedics (scoliosis management), and PT/OT.",
    "Follow closely to monitor **respiratory status**, nutritional status, and orthopedic complications (scoliosis, contractures), adjusting support as needed."
