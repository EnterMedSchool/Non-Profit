        "q1": "What is BMI?",
        "a1": "Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value calculated from a person's weight and height. It is used as a screening tool to categorize individuals into weight status categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. The World Health Organization (WHO) uses BMI as a standard measure for population-level health assessments.",
        "q2": "How is BMI calculated?",
        "a2": "BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared (kg/m²). For example, a person weighing 70 kg with a height of 1.75 m would have a BMI of 70 / (1.75 × 1.75) = 22.9. In imperial units, you can multiply weight in pounds by 703 and divide by height in inches squared.",
        "q3": "What is a healthy BMI range?",
        "a3": "According to the WHO, a healthy BMI for adults is between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m². A BMI below 18.5 is classified as underweight, 25.0 to 29.9 as overweight, and 30.0 or above as obese. These thresholds are designed for adults aged 20 and older; children and adolescents use age- and sex-specific percentile charts.",
        "q4": "What are the limitations of BMI?",
        "a4": "BMI does not distinguish between muscle mass, bone density, and fat mass. Athletes or muscular individuals may have a high BMI despite having low body fat. BMI also does not account for fat distribution — abdominal fat carries higher health risks than fat stored in other areas. Ethnicity, age, and sex can also influence the relationship between BMI and health risk.",
        "q5": "What is BMI Prime?",
        "a5": "BMI Prime is the ratio of a person's BMI to the upper limit of the healthy range (BMI 25). A BMI Prime of 1.0 means you are at the upper boundary of normal weight. Values below 1.0 indicate you are within or below the healthy range, while values above 1.0 indicate overweight or obesity. It provides a quick, intuitive way to see how far from the healthy threshold you are."

      "education": {
        "aboutTitle": "What Is Body Mass Index (BMI)?",
        "aboutBody": "Body Mass Index (BMI) is one of the most widely used measures in public health and clinical medicine. Developed by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet in the 1830s, BMI provides a simple numerical relationship between a person's weight and height. The World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and national health services worldwide use BMI to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems. While it is not a diagnostic tool on its own, BMI serves as a useful starting point for identifying potential health risks related to body weight.",
        "formulaTitle": "How Is BMI Calculated?",
        "formulaBody": "The BMI formula divides a person's body mass (in kilograms) by the square of their height (in meters). This produces a single number expressed in units of kg/m².",
        "formulaExample": "For example, a person who weighs 70 kg and is 1.75 m tall has a BMI of 70 / (1.75 × 1.75) = 22.9 kg/m², which falls within the normal weight category. In imperial units, the formula is: weight (lbs) × 703 / height (in)².",
        "limitationsTitle": "Limitations of BMI",
        "limitationsBody": "While BMI is a convenient screening metric, it has well-documented limitations that clinicians and researchers recognize:",
        "limitation1": "BMI does not distinguish between lean muscle mass, bone density, and body fat. Athletes and muscular individuals may be classified as overweight or obese despite having low body fat percentages.",
        "limitation2": "BMI does not account for fat distribution. Visceral (abdominal) fat is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, but BMI cannot measure where fat is stored in the body.",
        "limitation3": "The standard BMI thresholds were developed primarily from data on European populations. Research suggests that health risks associated with a given BMI may vary across different ethnic groups — for example, some Asian populations experience elevated risk at lower BMI values.",
        "limitation4": "BMI is designed for adults aged 20 and older. For children and adolescents, BMI is interpreted using age- and sex-specific percentile charts published by the WHO or CDC, as body composition changes significantly during growth and development.",
