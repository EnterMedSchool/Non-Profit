00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnterMedSchool—this is Leo.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today we're stepping into the Sphincter Club, where the bouncer has one rule: NO RELAX.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,000
This whole hallway is your esophagus, and notice how it funnels down toward that tight entrance—

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that's the lower esophageal sphincter, the LES.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:31,000
In achalasia, the LES fails to relax, so the distal esophagus becomes this tight 'club entrance'

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that won't open when it should.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:42,000
And because the entrance stays tight, pressure builds—think increased LES resting pressure—

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and everything upstream starts backing up like a line outside a club at midnight.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And here comes the main character: the massive bouncer posted at the door.

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,000
This is the LES in achalasia—too tight, won't relax,

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and basically says, 'Yeah… nobody's getting into the stomach tonight.'

12
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,000
So patients feel it as dysphagia—and achalasia is famous in medical school

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
because it causes progressive dysphagia… not just for solids, but solids AND liquids.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Now check out those ridiculously huge lips.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's your 'kissing' clue: Chagas disease from Trypanosoma cruzi,

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
spread by the kissing bug, can damage the nerves that normally tell this bouncer to chill out—

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
so Chagas can cause secondary achalasia.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Now look who's getting rejected: the VIPs… and the bouncer literally screams 'NO!'

19
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,000
That's not just attitude—it's physiology.

20
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,000
Normally, the myenteric (Auerbach) plexus in the esophageal wall has inhibitory neurons

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
that release NO and VIP.

22
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:31,000
These are the 'backstage managers' that tell the LES, 'Open the door, relax the muscle.'

23
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,000
In achalasia, those inhibitory neurons degenerate—so the LES loses its relaxation signals.

24
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:46,000
Translation: the bouncer never gets the 'VIP + NO' memo,

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
so the door stays tight and the line outside gets longer.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And instead of a normal guard dog… he's got a crab on a leash.

27
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,000
In medical school, crabs almost always scream cancer, and here the crab has two jobs.

28
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,000
Job one: an extraesophageal malignancy can create secondary achalasia—

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
either by mass effect squeezing things from the outside,

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
or via paraneoplastic effects messing with nerve function.

31
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,000
So cancer can cause an achalasia-like picture.

32
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:42,000
Job two: long-standing achalasia is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer—

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
because chronic stasis and irritation turn this hallway into a bad neighborhood over time.

34
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,000
So: cancer can be a mimic/cause, and also a downstream risk.

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Over here we've got the 'progressive' party crowd—

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
someone's trying solids with that burger, someone's trying liquids with the drink…

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and everybody's moving like the music has no rhythm.

38
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,000
That's achalasia: progressive dysphagia to solids AND liquids.

39
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,000
And here's the classic contrast for medical school:

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
mechanical obstruction usually hits solids first, because liquids can still sneak through.

41
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,000
Achalasia doesn't play favorites—both get stuck.

42
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,000
Now, the uncoordinated dancing is also your clue for manometry:

43
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,000
Manometry shows uncoordinated or absent peristalsis—the normal wave pattern is gone—

44
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
plus increased LES resting pressure.

45
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,000
So it's not just a tight door… the whole hallway has lost its coordinated 'push'.

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And now the diagnostic artist shows up with a bucket labeled BARIUM WHITE,

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
painting a bright white bird with a dramatic long beak right at the entrance.

48
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,000
That's your classic imaging: barium swallow shows a dilated esophagus

49
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
that tapers down into distal stenosis—the famous 'bird's beak' sign of achalasia.

50
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,000
So once you recognize this club scene—tight LES, lost NO/VIP inhibition,

51
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids, and that bird's beak on barium—

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
what do we do about it?

53
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,000
Treatment is about getting past the bouncer:

54
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,000
Surgery (think physically loosening that too-tight sphincter), and

55
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,000
Endoscopic procedures, like botulinum toxin injection—

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
basically 'Botox for the bouncer' to help the LES relax.

57
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,000
And that's achalasia: the Sphincter Club where the sign says 'NO RELAX'…

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and unfortunately, it means it.

59
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,000
Well.. unlike that club - I reviewed way too many flashcards today on this website -

60
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
time to relax. See you next time!
